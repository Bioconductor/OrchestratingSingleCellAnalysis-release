This is the website for __"Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor"__, a book that teaches users some common workflows for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq). This book will teach you how to make use of cutting-edge Bioconductor tools to process, analyze, visualize, and explore scRNA-seq data. Additionally, it serves as an online companion for the manuscript __"Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor"__. 

While we focus here on scRNA-seq data, a newer technology that profiles transcriptomes at the single-cell level, many of the tools, conventions, and analysis strategies utilized throughout this book are broadly applicable to other types of assays. By learning the grammar of Bioconductor workflows, we hope to provide you a starting point for the exploration of your own data, whether it be scRNA-seq or otherwise. 

The book is written in [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org). OSCA is a collaborative effort and many people have contributed workflows, fixes, and improvements.

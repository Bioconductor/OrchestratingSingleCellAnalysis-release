["index.html", "Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor Welcome", " Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor 2019-08-31 Welcome This is the website for “Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor”, a book that teaches users some common workflows for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq). This book will teach you how to make use of cutting-edge Bioconductor tools to process, analyze, visualize, and explore scRNA-seq data. Additionally, it serves as an online companion for the manuscript “Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor”. While we focus here on scRNA-seq data, a newer technology that profiles transcriptomes at the single-cell level, many of the tools, conventions, and analysis strategies utilized throughout this book are broadly applicable to other types of assays. By learning the grammar of Bioconductor workflows, we hope to provide you a starting point for the exploration of your own data, whether it be scRNA-seq or otherwise. This book is organized into three parts. In the Preamble, we introduce the book and dive into resources for learning R and Bioconductor (both at a beginner and developer level). Part I ends with a tutorial for a key data infrastructure, the SingleCellExperiment class, that is used throughout Bioconductor for single-cell analysis and in the subsequent section. The second part, Workflows, begins with an overview of the framework for analysis of scRNA-seq data - from purely prose, to just code, to a combination of the two. Deeper dives into specific topics are presented in each subsequent chapter. Finally, the appendix has information about the data used throughout the book, and highlights our contributors. If you would like to cite this work, please use the reference “Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor”. The book is written in RMarkdown with bookdown. OSCA is a collaborative effort, supported by various folks from the Bioconductor team who have contributed workflows, fixes, and improvements.

["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 What you will learn 1.2 What you won’t learn 1.3 Who we wrote this for 1.4 Why we wrote this 1.5 Acknowledgements", " Chapter 1 Introduction Bioconductor is an open source, open development software project to provide tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is based primarily on the R programming language. 1.1 What you will learn The goal of this book is to provide a solid foundation in the usage of Bioconductor tools for single-cell RNA-seq analysis by walking through various steps of typical workflows using example datasets. We strive to tackle key concepts covered in the manuscript, “Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor”, with each workflow covering these in varying detail, as well as essential preliminaries that are important for following along with the workflows on your own. 1.1.1 Preliminaries For those unfamiliar with R (and those looking to learn more), we recommend reading the Learning R and More chapter, which first and foremost covers how to get started with R. We point to many great online resources for learning R, as well as related tools that are nice to know for bioinformatic analysis. For advanced users, we also point to some extra resources that go beyond the basics. While we provide an extensive list of learning resources for the interested audience in this chapter, we only ask for some familiarity with R before going to the next section. We then briefly cover getting started with Using R and Bioconductor. Bioconductor, being its own repository, has a unique set of tools, documentation, resources, and practices that benefit from some extra explanation. Data Infrastructure merits a separate chapter. The reason for this is that common data containers are an essential part of Bioconductor workflows because they enable interoperability across packages, allowing for “plug and play” usage of cutting-edge tools. Specifically, here we cover the SingleCellExperiment class in depth, as it has become the working standard for Bioconductor based single-cell analysis packages. Finally, before diving into the various workflows, armed with knowledge about the SingleCellExperiment class, we briefly discuss the datasets that will be used throughout the book in About the Data. 1.1.2 Workflows All workflows begin with data import and subsequent quality control and normalization, going from a raw (count) expression matrix to a clean one. This includes adjusting for experimental factors and possibly even latent factors. Using the clean expression matrix, feature selection strategies can be applied to select the features (genes) driving heterogeneity. Furthermore, these features can then be used to perform dimensionality reduction, which enables downstream analysis that would not otherwise be possible and visualization on 2- or 3-dimensions. From there, the workflows largely focus on differing downstream analyses. Clustering details how to segment a scRNA-seq dataset, and differential expression provides a means to determine what drives the differences between different groups of cells. Integrating datasets walks through merging scRNA-seq datasets, an area of need as the number of scRNA-seq datasets continues to grow and comparisons between datasets must be done. Finally, we touch upon how to work with large scale data, specifically where it becomes impractical or impossible to work with data solely in-memory. As an added bonus, we dedicate a chapter to interactive visualization, which focuses on using the iSEE package to enable active exploration of a single cell experiment’s data. 1.2 What you won’t learn The field of bioinformatic analysis is large and filled with many potential trajectories depending on the biological system being studied and technology being deployed. Here, we only briefly survey some of the many tools available for the analysis of scRNA-seq, focusing on Bioconductor packages. It is impossible to thoroughly review the plethora of tools available through R and Bioconductor for biological analysis in one book, but we hope to provide the means for further exploration on your own. Thus, it goes without saying that you may not learn the optimal workflow for your own data from our examples - while we strive to provide high quality templates, they should be treated as just that - a template from which to extend upon for your own analyses. 1.3 Who we wrote this for We’ve written this book with the interested experimental biologist in mind, and do our best to make few assumptions on previous programming or statistical experience. Likewise, we also welcome more seasoned bioinformaticians who are looking for a starting point from which to dive into single-cell RNA-seq analysis. As such, we welcome any and all feedback for improving this book to help increase accessibility and refine technical details. 1.4 Why we wrote this This book was conceived in the fall of 2018, as single-cell RNA-seq analysis continued its rise in prominence in the field of biology. With its rapid growth, and the ongoing developments within Bioconductor tailored specifically for scRNA-seq, it became apparent that an update to the Orchestrating high-throughput genomic analysis with Bioconductor paper was necessary for the age of single-cell studies. We strive to highlight the fantastic software by people who call Bioconductor home for their tools, and in the process hope to showcase the Bioconductor community at large in continually pushing forward the field of biological analysis. 1.5 Acknowledgements We would like to thank all Bioconductor contributors for their efforts in creating the definitive leading-edge repository of software for biological analysis. It is truly extraordinary to chart the growth of Bioconductor over the years. We are thankful for the wonderful community of scientists and developers alike that together make the Bioconductor community special. We would first and foremost like to thank the Bioconductor core team and the emerging targets subcommittee for commissioning this work, Stephanie Hicks and Raphael Gottardo for their continuous mentorship, and all our contributors to the companion manuscript of this book. We’d also like to thank Garret Grolemund and Hadley Wickham for their book, R for Data Science, from which we drew stylistic and teaching inspiration. We also thank Levi Waldron and Aaron Lun for advice on the code-related aspects of managing the online version of this book. "],
["learning-r-and-more.html", "Chapter 2 Learning R and Bioconductor 2.1 The Benefits of R and Bioconductor 2.2 Learning R Online 2.3 Running R Locally 2.4 Getting Help In (and Out) of R 2.5 Bioconductor Help", " Chapter 2 Learning R and Bioconductor In this chapter, we outline various resources for learning R and Bioconductor. We provide a brief set of instructions for installing R on your own machine, and then cover how to get help for functions, packages, and Bioconductor-specific resources for learning more. 2.1 The Benefits of R and Bioconductor R is a high-level programming language that was initially designed for statistical applications. While there is much to be said about R as a programming language, one of the key advantages of using R is that it is highly extensible through packages. Packages are collections of functions, data, and documentation that extend the capabilities of base R. The ease of development and distribution of packages for R has made it a rich environment for many fields of study and application. One of the primary ways in which packages are distributed is through centralized repositories. The first R repository a user typically runs into is the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), which hosts over 13,000 packages to date, and is home to many of the most popular R packages. Similar to CRAN, Bioconductor is a repository of R packages as well. However, whereas CRAN is a general purpose repository, Bioconductor focuses on software tailored for genomic analysis. Furthermore, Bioconductor has stricter requirements for a package to be accepted into the repository. Of particular interest to us is the inclusion of high quality documentation and the use of common data infrastructure to promote package interoperability. In order to use these packages from CRAN and Bioconductor, and start programming with R to follow along in these workflows, some knowledge of R is helpful. Here we outline resources to guide you through learning the basics. 2.2 Learning R Online To learn more about programming with R, we highly recommend checking out the online courses offered by Datacamp, which includes both introductory and advanced courses within the R track. Datacamp is all online with many free courses, with videos and a code editor/console that promotes an interactive learning experience. What we like about Datacamp is that it is more focused on topics and programming paradigms that center around data science, which is especially helpful for getting started with R. Beyond just Datacamp, a mainstay resource for learning R is the R for Data Science book. This book illustrates R programming through the exploration of various data science concepts - transformation, visualization, exploration, and more. 2.3 Running R Locally While learning R through online resources is a great way to start with R, as it requires minimal knowledge to start up, at some point, it will be desirable to have a local installation - on your own hardware - of R. This will allow you to install and maintain your own software and code, and furthermore allow you to create a personalized workspace. 2.3.1 Installing R Prior to getting started with this book, some prior programming experience with R is helpful. Check out the Learning R and More chapter for a list of resources to get started with R and other useful tools for bioinformatic analysis. To follow along with the analysis workflows in this book on your personal computer, it is first necessary to install the R programming language. Additionally, we recommend a graphical user interface such as RStudio for programming in R and visualization. RStudio features many helpful tools, such as code completion and an interactive data viewer to name but two. For more details, please see the online book R for Data Science prerequisites section for more information about installing R and using RStudio. 2.3.1.1 For MacOS/Linux Users A special note for MacOS/Linux users: we highly recommend using a package manager to manage your R installation. This differs across different Linux distributions, but for MacOS we highly recommend the Homebrew package manager. Follow the website directions to install homebrew, and install R via the commandline with brew install R, and it will automatically configure your installation for you. Upgrading to new R versions can be done by running brew upgrade. 2.3.2 Installing R &amp; Bioconductor Packages After installing R, the next step is to install R packages. In the R console, you can install packages from CRAN via the install.packages() function. In order to install Bioconductor packages, we will first need the BiocManager package which is hosted on CRAN. This can be done by running: install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) The BiocManager package makes it easy to install packages from the Bioconductor repository. For example, to install the SingleCellExperiment package, we run: ## the command below is a one-line shortcut for: ## library(BiocManager) ## install(&quot;SingleCellExperiment&quot;) BiocManager::install(&quot;SingleCellExperiment&quot;) Throughout the book, we can load packages via the library() function, which by convention usually comes at the top of scripts to alert readers as to what packages are required. For example, to load the SingleCellExperiment package, we run: library(SingleCellExperiment) Many packages will be referenced throughout the book within the workflows, and similar to the above, can be installed using the BiocManager::install() function. 2.4 Getting Help In (and Out) of R One of the most helpful parts of R is being able to get help inside of R. For example, to get the manual associated with a function, class, dataset, or package, you can prepend the code of interest with a ? to retrieve the relevant help page. For example, to get information about the data.frame() function, the SingleCellExperiment class, the in-built iris dataset, or for the BiocManager package, you can type: ?data.frame ?SingleCellExperiment ?iris ?BiocManager Beyond the R console, there are myriad online resources to get help. The R for Data Science book has a great section dedicated to looking for help outside of R. In particular, Stackoverflow’s R tag is a helpful resource for asking and exploring general R programming questions. 2.5 Bioconductor Help One of the key tenets of Bioconductor software that makes it stand out from CRAN is the required documentation of packages and workflows. In addition, Bioconductor hosts a Bioconductor-specific support site that has grown into a valuable resource of its own, thanks to the work of dedicated volunteers. 2.5.1 Bioconductor Packages Each package hosted on Bioconductor has a dedicated page with various resources. For an example, looking at the scater package page on Bioconductor, we see that it contains: a brief description of the package at the top, in addition to the authors, maintainer, and an associated citation installation instructions that can be cut and paste into your R console documentation - vignettes, reference manual, news Here, the most important information comes from the documentation section. Every package in Bioconductor is required to be submitted with a vignette - a document showcasing basic functionality of the package. Typically, these vignettes have a descriptive title that summarizes the main objective of the vignette. These vignettes are a great resource for learning how to operate the essential functionality of the package. The reference manual contains a comprehensive listing of all the functions available in the package. This is a compilation of each function’s manual, aka help pages, which can be accessed programmatically in the R console via ?&lt;function&gt;. Finally, the NEWS file contains notes from the authors which highlight changes across different versions of the package. This is a great way of tracking changes, especially functions that are added, removed, or deprecated, in order to keep your scripts current with new versions of dependent packages. Below this, the Details section covers finer nuances of the package, mostly relating to its relationship to other packages: upstream dependencies (Depends, Imports, Suggests fields): packages that are imported upon loading the given package downstream dependencies (Depends On Me, Imports Me, Suggests Me): packages that import the given package when loaded For example, we can see that an entry called simpleSingle in the Depends On Me field on the scater page takes us to a step-by-step workflow for low-level analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. One additional Details entry, the biocViews, is helpful for looking at how the authors annotate their package. For example, for the scater package, we see that it is associated with DataImport, DimensionReduction, GeneExpression, RNASeq, and SingleCell, to name but some of its many annotations. We cover biocViews in more detail. 2.5.2 biocViews To find packages via the Bioconductor website, one useful resource is the BiocViews page, which provides a hierarchically organized view of annotations associated with Bioconductor packages. Under the “Software” label for example (which is comprised of most of the Bioconductor packages), there exist many different views to explore packages. For example, we can inspect based on the associated “Technology”, and explore “Sequencing” associated packages, and furthermore subset based on “RNASeq”. Another area of particular interest is the “Workflow” view, which provides Bioconductor packages that illustrate an analytical workflow. For example, the “SingleCellWorkflow” contains the aforementioned tutorial, encapsulated in the simpleSingleCell package. 2.5.3 Bioconductor Forums The Bioconductor support site contains a Stackoverflow-style question and answer support site that is actively contributed to from both users and package developers. Thanks to the work of dedicated volunteers, there are ample questions to explore to learn more about Bioconductor specific workflows. Another way to connect with the Bioconductor community is through Slack, which hosts various channels dedicated to packages and workflows. The Bioc-community Slack is a great way to stay in the loop on the latest developments happening across Bioconductor, and we recommend exploring the “Channels” section to find topics of interest. "],
["beyond-r-basics.html", "Chapter 3 Beyond R Basics 3.1 Becoming an R Expert 3.2 Becoming an R/Bioconductor Developer 3.3 Nice Companions for R", " Chapter 3 Beyond R Basics Here we briefly outline resources for taking your R programming to the next level, including resources for learning about package development. We also outline some companions to R that are good to know not only for package development, but also for running your own bioinformatic pipelines, enabling you to use a broader array of tools to go from raw data to preprocessed data before working in R. 3.1 Becoming an R Expert For a deeper dive into the finer details of the R programming language, the Advanced R. While targeted at more experienced R users and programmers, this book represents a comprehensive compendium of more advanced concepts, and touches on some of the paradigms used extensively by developers throughout Bioconductor, specifically programming with S4. Eventually, you’ll reach the point where you have your own collection of functions, datasets, and reach the point where you will be writing your own packages. Luckily, there’s a guide for just that, with the book R Packages. Packages are great even if just for personal use, and of course, with some polishing, can eventually become a package available on CRAN or Bioconductor. Furthermore, they are also a great way of putting together code associated with a manuscript, promoting reproducible, accessible computing practices, something we all strive for in our work. For many of the little details that are oft forgotten learning about R, the aptly named What They Forgot to Teach You About R is a great read for learning about the little things such as file naming, maintaining an R installation, and reproducible analysis habits. Finally, we save the most intriguing resource for last - another book for those on the road to becoming an R expert is R Inferno, which dives into many of the unique quirks of R. Warning: this book goes very deep into the painstaking details of R. 3.2 Becoming an R/Bioconductor Developer While learning to use Bioconductor tools is a very welcoming experience, unfortunately there is no central resource for navigating the plethora of gotchas and paradigms associated with developing for Bioconductor. Based on conversations with folks involved in developing for Bioconductor, much of this knowledge is hard won and fairly spread out. This however is beginning to change with more recent efforts led by the Bioconductor team, and while this book represents an earnest effort towards addressing the user perspective, it is currently out of scope to include a deep dive about the developer side. For those looking to get started with developing packages for Bioconductor, it is important to first become acquainted with developing standalone R packages. To this end, the R Packages book provides a deep dive into the details of constructing your own package, as well as details regarding submission of a package to CRAN. For programming practices, With that, some resources that are worth looking into to get started are the BiocWorkshops repository under the Bioconductor Github provides a book composed of workshops that have been hosted by Bioconductor team members and contributors. These workshops center around learning, using, and developing for Bioconductor. A host of topics are also available via the Learn module on the Bioconductor website as well. Finally, the Bioconductor developers portal contains a bevy of individual resources and guides for experienced R developers. 3.3 Nice Companions for R While not essential for our purposes, many bioinformatic tools for processing raw sequencing data require knowledge beyond just R to install, run, and import their results into R for further analysis. The most important of which are basic knowledge of the Shell/Bash utilities, for working with bioinformatic pipelines and troubleshooting (R package) installation issues. Additionally, for working with packages or software that are still in development and not hosted on an official repository like CRAN or Bioconductor, knowledge of Git - a version control system - and the popular Github repository is helpful. This enables you to not only work with other people’s code, but also better manage your own code to keep track of changes. 3.3.1 Shell/Bash Datacamp and other interactive online resources such as Codecademy are great places to learn some of these extra skills. We highly recommend learning Shell/Bash, as it is the starting point for most bioinformatic processing pipelines. 3.3.2 Git We would recommend learning Git next, a system for code versioning control which underlies the popular Github repository, where many of the most popular open source tools are hosted. Learning Git is essential for not only keeping track of your own code, but also for using, managing, and contributing to open source software projects. For a more R centric look at using Git (and Github), we highly recommend checking out Happy Git and Github for the useR. 3.3.3 Other Languages A frequent question that comes up is “What else should I learn besides R?” Firstly, we believe that honing your R skills is first and foremost, and beyond just R, learning Shell/Bash and Git covered in the Nice Companions for R section are already a great start. For those just getting started, these skills should become comfortable in practice before moving on. However, there are indeed benefits to going beyond just R. At a basic level, learning other programming languages helps broaden one’s perspective - similar to learning multiple spoken or written languages, learning about other programming languages (even if only in a cursory manner) helps one identify broader patterns that may be applicable across languages. At an applied level, work within and outside of R has made it ever more friendly now than ever before with multi-lingual setups and teams, enabling the use of the best tool for the job at hand. For example, Python is another popular language used in both data science and a broader array of applications as well. R now supports a native Python interface via the reticulate package, enabling access to tools developed originally in Python such as the popular TensorFlow framework for machine learning applications. C++ is frequently used natively in R as well via Rcpp in packages to massively accelerate computations. Finally, multiple langauges are supported in code documents and reports through R Markdown. "],
["data-infrastructure.html", "Chapter 4 Data Infrastructure 4.1 Prerequisites 4.2 The SingleCellExperiment Class 4.3 A Brief Recap: From se to sce 4.4 The reducedDims Slot 4.5 One More Thing: metadata Slot 4.6 About Spike-Ins 4.7 Working with SingleCellExperiment 4.8 The Centrality of SingleCellExperiment 4.9 Multimodal Data: MultiAssayExperiment", " Chapter 4 Data Infrastructure One of the advantages of using Bioconductor packages is that they utilize common data infrastructures which makes analyses interoperable across various packages. Furthermore, much engineering effort is put into making this infrastructure robust and scalable. Here, we describe the SingleCellExperiment object (or sce in shorthand) in detail to describe how it is constructed, utilized in downstream analysis, and how it stores various types of primary data and metadata. 4.1 Prerequisites The Bioconductor package SingleCellExperiment provides the SingleCellExperiment class for usage. While the package is implicitly installed and loaded when using any package that depends on the SingleCellExperiment class, it can be explicitly installed (and loaded) as follows: BiocManager::install(&#39;SingleCellExperiment&#39;) Additionally, we use some functions from the scater and scran packages, as well as the CRAN package uwot (which conveniently can also be installed through BiocManager). These functions will be accessed through the &lt;package&gt;::&lt;function&gt; convention as needed. BiocManager::install(c(&#39;scater&#39;, &#39;scran&#39;, &#39;uwot&#39;)) For this session, all we will need loaded is the SingleCellExperiment package: library(SingleCellExperiment) 4.2 The SingleCellExperiment Class Overview of the SingleCellExperiment class object 4.2.1 Primary Data: The assays Slot The SingleCellExperiment (sce) object is the basis of single-cell analytical applications based in Bioconductor. The sce object is an S4 object, which in essence provides a more formalized approach towards construction and accession of data compared to other methods available in R. The utility of S4 comes from validity checks that ensure that safe data manipulation, and most important for our discussion, from its extensibility through slots. If we imagine the sce object to be a ship, the slots of sce can be thought of as individual cargo boxes - each exists as a separate entity within the sce object. Furthermore, each slot contains data that arrives in its own format. To extend the metaphor, we can imagine that different variations of cargo boxes are required for fruits versus bricks. In the case of sce, certain slots expect numeric matrices, whereas others may expect data frames. To construct a rudimentary sce object, all we need is a single slot: assays slot: contains primary data such as counts in list, where each entry of the list is in a matrix format, where rows correspond to features (genes) and columns correspond to samples (cells) (Figure 1A, blue box) Let’s start simple by generating three cells worth of count data across ten genes. counts_matrix &lt;- data.frame(cell_1 = rpois(10, 10), cell_2 = rpois(10, 10), cell_3 = rpois(10, 30)) rownames(counts_matrix) &lt;- paste0(&quot;gene_&quot;, 1:10) counts_matrix &lt;- as.matrix(counts_matrix) # must be a matrix object! From this, we can now construct our first SingleCellExperiment object, using the defined constructor, SingleCellExperiment(). Note that we provide our data as a named list, and each entry of the list is a matrix. Here, we name the counts_matrix entry as simply counts within the list. sce &lt;- SingleCellExperiment(assays = list(counts = counts_matrix)) To inspect the object, we can simply type sce into the console to see some pertinent information, which will display an overview of the various slots available to us (which may or may not have any data). sce ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 10 3 ## metadata(0): ## assays(1): counts ## rownames(10): gene_1 gene_2 ... gene_9 gene_10 ## rowData names(0): ## colnames(3): cell_1 cell_2 cell_3 ## colData names(0): ## reducedDimNames(0): ## spikeNames(0): ## altExpNames(0): To access the count data we just supplied, we can do any one of the following: assay(sce, &quot;counts&quot;) - this is the most general method, where we can supply the name of the assay as the second argument. counts(sce) - this is the same as the above, but only works for assays with the special name &quot;counts&quot;. counts(sce) ## cell_1 cell_2 cell_3 ## gene_1 11 9 34 ## gene_2 9 15 29 ## gene_3 14 13 31 ## gene_4 7 6 26 ## gene_5 8 10 29 ## gene_6 8 6 28 ## gene_7 10 10 25 ## gene_8 10 5 31 ## gene_9 7 5 27 ## gene_10 18 15 27 ## assay(sce, &quot;counts&quot;) ## same as above in this special case 4.2.2 Extending the assays Slot What makes the assay slot especially powerful is that it can hold multiple representations of the primary data. This is especially useful for storing a normalized version of the data. We can do just that as shown below, using the scran and scater packages to compute a log-count normalized representation of the initial primary data. Note that here, we overwrite our previous sce upon reassigning the results to sce - this is because these functions return a SingleCellExperiment object. Some functions - especially those outside of single-cell oriented Bioconductor packages - do not, in which case you will need to append your results to the sce object (see below). sce &lt;- scran::computeSumFactors(sce) sce &lt;- scater::normalize(sce) Viewing the object again, we see that these functions added some new entries: sce ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 10 3 ## metadata(1): log.exprs.offset ## assays(2): counts logcounts ## rownames(10): gene_1 gene_2 ... gene_9 gene_10 ## rowData names(0): ## colnames(3): cell_1 cell_2 cell_3 ## colData names(0): ## reducedDimNames(0): ## spikeNames(0): ## altExpNames(0): Specifically, we see that the assays slot has grown to be comprised of two entries: counts (our initial data) and logcounts (the normalized data). Similar to counts, the logcounts name is a special name which lets us access it simply by typing logcounts(sce), although the longhand version works just as well. logcounts(sce) ## cell_1 cell_2 cell_3 ## gene_1 4.20 4.04 4.33 ## gene_2 3.93 4.74 4.11 ## gene_3 4.53 4.54 4.20 ## gene_4 3.59 3.50 3.96 ## gene_5 3.77 4.18 4.11 ## gene_6 3.77 3.50 4.06 ## gene_7 4.07 4.18 3.91 ## gene_8 4.07 3.26 4.20 ## gene_9 3.59 3.26 4.01 ## gene_10 4.88 4.74 4.01 ## assay(sce, &quot;logcounts&quot;) ## same as above Notice that the data before had a severe discrepancy in counts between cells 1/2 versus 3, and that normalization has ameliorated this difference. To look at all the available assays within sce, we can type: assays(sce) ## List of length 2 ## names(2): counts logcounts While the functions above demonstrate automatic addition of assays to our sce object, there may be cases where we want to perform our own calculations and save the result into the assays slot. In particular, this is important for using functions that do not return your SingleCellExperiment object. Let’s append a new version of the data that has been offset by +100. counts_100 &lt;- assay(sce, &quot;counts&quot;) + 100 assay(sce, &quot;counts_100&quot;) &lt;- counts_100 # assign a new entry to assays slot Then we can use the accessor assays() (notice this is plural!) to see all our entries into the assay slot that we have made so far. Note that to see the names of all the assays, we use the plural assays() accessor, and to retrieve a single assay entry (as a matrix) we use the singular assay() accessor, providing the name of the assay we wish to retrieve as above. assays(sce) ## List of length 3 ## names(3): counts logcounts counts_100 These entries are also seen on the default view of sce: sce ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 10 3 ## metadata(1): log.exprs.offset ## assays(3): counts logcounts counts_100 ## rownames(10): gene_1 gene_2 ... gene_9 gene_10 ## rowData names(0): ## colnames(3): cell_1 cell_2 cell_3 ## colData names(0): ## reducedDimNames(0): ## spikeNames(0): ## altExpNames(0): This sort of extension of the assays slot is represented graphically in Figure 1B (dark blue box), showing the addition of the logcounts matrix into the assays slot. In a similar manner, many of the slots of sce are extendable through assignment as shown above, thus allowing for myriad custom functionality as needed for interoperability with functions outside of single-cell oriented Bioconductor packages. 4.2.3 Column (Meta)Data: colData Slot To further annotate our sce object, one of the first and most useful pieces of information is adding on metadata that describes the columns of our primary data, e.g. describing the samples or cells of our experiment. This data is entered into the colData slot: colData slot: metadata that describes that samples (cells) provided as a data.frame or (DataFrame if appending), where rows correspond to cells, and columns correspond to the sample (cells) metadata features (e.g. id, batch, author, etc.) (Figure 1A, orange box). So, let’s come up with some metadata for the cells, starting with a batch variable, where cells 1 and 2 are in batch 1, and cell 3 is from batch 2. cell_metadata &lt;- data.frame(batch = c(1, 1, 2)) rownames(cell_metadata) &lt;- paste0(&quot;cell_&quot;, 1:3) Now, we can take two approaches - either append the cell_metadata to our existing sce, or start from scratch via the SingleCellExperiment() constructor and provide it from the get go. We’ll start from scratch for now, but will also show how to append the data as well: ## From scratch: sce &lt;- SingleCellExperiment(assays = list(counts = counts_matrix), colData = cell_metadata) ## Appending to existing object (requires DataFrame() coercion) ## colData(sce) &lt;- DataFrame(cell_metadata) Similar to assays, we can see our colData is now populated from the default view of sce: sce ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 10 3 ## metadata(0): ## assays(1): counts ## rownames(10): gene_1 gene_2 ... gene_9 gene_10 ## rowData names(0): ## colnames(3): cell_1 cell_2 cell_3 ## colData names(1): batch ## reducedDimNames(0): ## spikeNames(0): ## altExpNames(0): And furthermore access our column (meta)data with the accessor, colData(): colData(sce) ## DataFrame with 3 rows and 1 column ## batch ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## cell_1 1 ## cell_2 1 ## cell_3 2 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 1 ## 1 ## 2 Finally, some packages automatically add to the colData slot, for example, the scater package features a function, calculateQCMetrics(), which appends a lot of quality control data. Here we show the first five columns of colData(sce) with the quality control metrics appended to it. sce &lt;- scater::calculateQCMetrics(sce) colData(sce)[, 1:5] ## DataFrame with 3 rows and 5 columns ## batch is_cell_control total_features_by_counts ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;logical&gt; &lt;integer&gt; ## cell_1 1 FALSE 10 ## cell_2 1 FALSE 10 ## cell_3 2 FALSE 10 ## log10_total_features_by_counts total_counts ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;integer&gt; ## cell_1 1.04139268515822 102 ## cell_2 1.04139268515822 94 ## cell_3 1.04139268515822 287 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 1 ## 1 ## 2 ## &lt;logical&gt; ## FALSE ## FALSE ## FALSE ## &lt;integer&gt; ## 10 ## 10 ## 10 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 1.04139268515822 ## 1.04139268515822 ## 1.04139268515822 ## &lt;integer&gt; ## 102 ## 94 ## 287 4.2.3.1 Using colData for Subsetting A common operation with colData is its use in subsetting. One simple way to access colData is through the use of the $ operator, which is a shortcut for accessing a variable within the colData slot: sce$batch ## [1] 1 1 2 ## colData(sce)$batch # same as above If we only wanted cells within batch 1, we could subset our sce object as follows (remember, we subset on the columns in this case because we are filtering by cells/samples here). sce[, sce$batch == 1] ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 10 2 ## metadata(0): ## assays(1): counts ## rownames(10): gene_1 gene_2 ... gene_9 gene_10 ## rowData names(7): is_feature_control mean_counts ... total_counts ## log10_total_counts ## colnames(2): cell_1 cell_2 ## colData names(10): batch is_cell_control ... ## pct_counts_in_top_200_features pct_counts_in_top_500_features ## reducedDimNames(0): ## spikeNames(0): ## altExpNames(0): 4.2.4 Feature Metadata: rowData/rowRanges Lastly, the rows also have their own metadata slot to store information that pertains to the features of the sce object: rowData slot: contains data in a data.frame (DataFrame) format that describes aspects of the data corresponding to the rows of the primary data (Figure 1A, green box). Furthermore, there is a special slot which pertains to features with genomic coordinates: rowRanges slot: contains data in a GRangesList (where each entry is a GenomicRanges format) that describes the chromosome, start, and end coordinates of the features (genes, genomic regions). Both of these can be accessed via their respective accessors, rowRanges() and rowData(). In our case, rowRanges(sce) produces an empty list: rowRanges(sce) # empty ## GRangesList object of length 10: ## $gene_1 ## GRanges object with 0 ranges and 0 metadata columns: ## seqnames ranges strand ## &lt;Rle&gt; &lt;IRanges&gt; &lt;Rle&gt; ## ------- ## seqinfo: no sequences ## ## $gene_2 ## GRanges object with 0 ranges and 0 metadata columns: ## seqnames ranges strand ## &lt;Rle&gt; &lt;IRanges&gt; &lt;Rle&gt; ## ------- ## seqinfo: no sequences ## ## $gene_3 ## GRanges object with 0 ranges and 0 metadata columns: ## seqnames ranges strand ## &lt;Rle&gt; &lt;IRanges&gt; &lt;Rle&gt; ## ------- ## seqinfo: no sequences ## ## ... ## &lt;7 more elements&gt; However, our call to calculateQCMetrics(sce) in the prior section filled in the rowData slot of our sce object, as we can see below (only the first three columns are shown for brevity): rowData(sce)[, 1:3] ## DataFrame with 10 rows and 3 columns ## is_feature_control mean_counts log10_mean_counts ## &lt;logical&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## gene_1 FALSE 18 1.27875360095283 ## gene_2 FALSE 17.6666666666667 1.27106677228654 ## gene_3 FALSE 19.3333333333333 1.3082085802911 ## gene_4 FALSE 13 1.14612803567824 ## gene_5 FALSE 15.6666666666667 1.22184874961636 ## gene_6 FALSE 14 1.17609125905568 ## gene_7 FALSE 15 1.20411998265592 ## gene_8 FALSE 15.3333333333333 1.21307482530885 ## gene_9 FALSE 13 1.14612803567824 ## gene_10 FALSE 20 1.32221929473392 ## &lt;logical&gt; ## FALSE ## FALSE ## FALSE ## FALSE ## FALSE ## FALSE ## FALSE ## FALSE ## FALSE ## FALSE ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 18 ## 17.6666666666667 ## 19.3333333333333 ## 13 ## 15.6666666666667 ## 14 ## 15 ## 15.3333333333333 ## 13 ## 20 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 1.27875360095283 ## 1.27106677228654 ## 1.3082085802911 ## 1.14612803567824 ## 1.22184874961636 ## 1.17609125905568 ## 1.20411998265592 ## 1.21307482530885 ## 1.14612803567824 ## 1.32221929473392 In a similar fashion to the colData slot, such feature metadata could be provided at the onset when creating the SingleCellExperiment object, which we leave up to the reader as an exercise. 4.2.4.1 Subsetting with on Rows To subset an sce object down at the feature/gene level, we can do a row subsetting operation similar to other R objects, by supplying either numeric indices or a vector of names: sce[c(&quot;gene_1&quot;, &quot;gene_4&quot;), ] ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 2 3 ## metadata(0): ## assays(1): counts ## rownames(2): gene_1 gene_4 ## rowData names(7): is_feature_control mean_counts ... total_counts ## log10_total_counts ## colnames(3): cell_1 cell_2 cell_3 ## colData names(10): batch is_cell_control ... ## pct_counts_in_top_200_features pct_counts_in_top_500_features ## reducedDimNames(0): ## spikeNames(0): ## altExpNames(0): ## sce[c(1, 4), ] # same as above in this case 4.2.5 Size Factors Slot: sizeFactors Briefly, we already encountered this via the scran::computeSumFactors(sce) call, which adds a sizeFactors slot: sizeFactors slot: contains information in a numeric vector regarding the sample/cell normalization factors used to produce a normalize data representation (Figure 1B, brown box) sce &lt;- scran::computeSumFactors(sce) sce &lt;- scater::normalize(sce) sizeFactors(sce) ## [1] 0.634 0.584 1.783 4.3 A Brief Recap: From se to sce So far, we have covered the assays (primary data), colData (sample metadata), rowData/rowRanges (feature metadata), and sizeFactors slots of SingleCellExperiment. What is important to note is that the SingleCellExperiment class derives from the SummarizedExperiment (se) class, its predecessor, and in particular inherits the aforementioned slots. As such, much of the SummarizedExperiment functionality is retained in SingleCellExperiment. This allows existing methods that work with SummarizedExperiment to work similarly on SingleCellExperiment objects. So what’s new about the SingleCellExperiment class then? For our discussion, the most important change is the addition of a new slot called reducedDims. 4.4 The reducedDims Slot The reducedDims slot is a new addition which is specially designed to store the reduced dimensionality representations of primary data, such as PCA, tSNE, UMAP, and others. reducedDims slot: contains a list of numeric matrix entries which describe dimensionality reduced representations of the primary data, such that rows represent the columns of the primary data (aka the samples/cells), and columns represent the dimensions Most importantly, just like the assays slot, the reducedDims slot can hold a list of many entries. So, it can hold a PCA, TSNE, and UMAP representation of a given dataset all within the reducedDims slot. In our example, we can calculate a PCA representation of our data as follows using the scater package function runPCA(). We see that the sce now shows a new reducedDim and that the accessor reducedDim() produces the results of running PCA on the normalized data from logcounts(sce). sce &lt;- scater::runPCA(sce) reducedDim(sce, &quot;PCA&quot;) ## PC1 PC2 PC3 ## cell_1 0.0755 0.593 4.55e-16 ## cell_2 -0.9312 -0.259 4.55e-16 ## cell_3 0.8557 -0.334 4.55e-16 ## attr(,&quot;percentVar&quot;) ## [1] 7.51e+01 2.49e+01 2.91e-29 From this, we can also calculate a tSNE representation using the scater package function runTSNE(), and see that it can be seen both in the default view of sce and via accession: sce &lt;- scater::runTSNE(sce, perplexity = 0.1) ## Perplexity should be lower than K! reducedDim(sce, &quot;TSNE&quot;) ## [,1] [,2] ## cell_1 4953.3 2805 ## cell_2 -42.9 -5693 ## cell_3 -4910.4 2888 We can view the names of all our entries in the reducedDims slot via the accessor, reducedDims() (notice that this is plural, and thus not the same as reducedDim(): reducedDims(sce) ## List of length 2 ## names(2): PCA TSNE Now, say we have a different dimensionality reduction approach which has not yet been implemented with SingleCellExperiment objects in mind. For example, let’s say we want to try the umap() function as implemented in the uwot package (which is a much faster version of the default umap implementation currently in scater). Similar to how we extended the assays slot with our own custom entry of counts_100, we can do similarly for the reducedDims slot: u &lt;- uwot::umap(t(logcounts(sce)), n_neighbors = 2) reducedDim(sce, &quot;UMAP_uwot&quot;) &lt;- u reducedDim(sce, &quot;UMAP_uwot&quot;) ## [,1] [,2] ## cell_1 -0.268 -0.298 ## cell_2 -0.353 0.554 ## cell_3 0.621 -0.256 ## attr(,&quot;scaled:center&quot;) ## [1] -14.87 -3.47 And we can also see its entry when we look at the reducedDims() accessor output: reducedDims(sce) ## List of length 3 ## names(3): PCA TSNE UMAP_uwot 4.5 One More Thing: metadata Slot Some analyses produce results that do not fit into the aforementioned slots. Thankfully, there is a slot just for this type of messy data, and in fact, can accommodate any type of data, so long as it is in a named list: metadata slot: a named list of entries, where each entry in the list can be anything you want it to be For example, say we have some favorite genes, such as highly variable genes, we want to save inside of sce for use in our analysis at a later point. We can do this simply by appending to the metadata slot as follows: my_genes &lt;- c(&quot;gene_1&quot;, &quot;gene_5&quot;) metadata(sce) &lt;- list(favorite_genes = my_genes) metadata(sce) ## $favorite_genes ## [1] &quot;gene_1&quot; &quot;gene_5&quot; Similarly, we can append more information via the $ operator: your_genes &lt;- c(&quot;gene_4&quot;, &quot;gene_8&quot;) metadata(sce)$your_genes &lt;- your_genes metadata(sce) ## $favorite_genes ## [1] &quot;gene_1&quot; &quot;gene_5&quot; ## ## $your_genes ## [1] &quot;gene_4&quot; &quot;gene_8&quot; 4.6 About Spike-Ins You might have noticed that the sce default view produces an entry with spikeNames. The SingleCellExperiment object contains some special considerations for experiments with spike-in (ERCC) controls. We leave this to the interested reader to learn more about in the SingleCellExperiment introductory vignette. 4.7 Working with SingleCellExperiment In subsequent sections, we will show an example workflow that uses the SingleCellExperiment object as its base, and similar to our walkthrough of the SingleCellExperiment class above, continually appends new entries to save the results of the analysis. The SingleCellExperiment thus can serve as a record of analysis in this manner. This makes it especially useful for collaboration, as the object can be transferred and then visualized via graphical user interfaces such as iSEE. 4.8 The Centrality of SingleCellExperiment Graph network of package dependencies linking to the SingleCellExperiment package (class). Packages are filtered by biocView “singleCell”. To emphasize its importance, here we show the centrality of the SingleCellExperiment class to the Bioc-verse single-cell related packages. It is this connection to SingleCellExperiment that makes many of these packages easily interoperable and modular over the span of an scRNA-seq analysis. 4.9 Multimodal Data: MultiAssayExperiment Recent advances in technology and protocols allow the simultaneous collection of DNA and RNA from the same cells, enabling single-cell multi-modal analysis. These data present new challenges in the complexity of statistical analyses, which are addressed in Bioconductor through the MultiAssayExperiment container. The MultiAssayExperiment class integrates all major Bioconductor experimental data containers, and any containers derived from those, including SingleCellExperiment. It provides harmonized data management for heterogeneous assays, including subsetting by genomic identifiers, genomic coordinates, or sample/cell attributes such as cell type. The user interface mimics that of SingleCellExperiment, with comparable actions working across all assays. Multi-modal profiling is an emergent area of single-cell biology with many exciting technologies coming online, such as gene expression profiling in tandem with protein via CITE-seq/REAP-seq and adaptive repertoire sequencing. While we won’t cover multimodal data analysis further in this online book as of this writing, we anticipate infrastructure and statistical methodology advances in this area in the near future. document.addEventListener(\"click\", function (event) { if (event.target.classList.contains(\"aaron-collapse\")) { event.target.classList.toggle(\"active\"); var content = event.target.nextElementSibling; if (content.style.display === \"block\") { content.style.display = \"none\"; } else { content.style.display = \"block\"; } } }) .aaron-collapse { background-color: #eee; color: #444; cursor: pointer; padding: 18px; width: 100%; border: none; text-align: left; outline: none; font-size: 15px; } .aaron-content { padding: 0 18px; display: none; overflow: hidden; background-color: #f1f1f1; } "],
["analytical-workflow-overview.html", "Chapter 5 Analytical Workflow Overview 5.1 Experimental Design 5.2 Preprocessing 5.3 Import to R 5.4 Data Processing", " Chapter 5 Analytical Workflow Overview Figure 1. Overview of a typical scRNA-seq workflow. In this chapter, we will orient you to the framework of scRNA-seq, shown in the figure above. This chapter will primarily be textual to give a brief conceptual basis to each of the steps presented below. In the subsequent chapter we will walk through a minimal analysis of a simple scRNA-seq dataset to put code to the concepts presented here, before breaking down individual steps and highlighting alternate or more advanced ways of performing specific tasks. 5.1 Experimental Design Before getting started with actual code, a brief word on the importance of experimental design is warranted. This step is done prior to any sequencing, and involves the proper annotation of associated experimental metadata. This metadata is essential, if not for downstream analyses then at minimum for publication of the dataset and submission to public repositories such as NCBI GEO. Some key metadata to record includes, but is not limited to: Experimental aspects: batch, operator/author, date collected, date processed, date submitted for sequencing Biological traits: organism, sex, age, tissue, isolate, disease Perturbations: genotype, treatment Sequencing strategy: molecule, source, strategy, target, instrument model, read length, single vs paired-end sequencing, barcodes And finally, long form descriptions should be provided alongside informative sample names that encompass the key variables of the experiment. This metadata will often be read in and supplied as colData into the constructed SingleCellExperiment class object. 5.2 Preprocessing Once an experiment has been processed and sequenced, scRNA-seq experiments must be aligned to the transcriptome, and subsequently the reads must be quantified into a counts matrix of expression values consisting of cells versus the features of interest (genes or transcripts). While the specific bioinformatic choices defining this preprocessing pipeline are often technology- or platform-dependent, they are worth discussing briefly. Many popular preprocessing methods are available as command line software that is run outside of R: For the 10X Genomics platform, 10X provides Cell Ranger, which executes a custom pipeline compatible with gene expression as well as feature barcoding techniques such as CITE-seq. Under the hood, it uses the STAR aligner. For droplet-based scRNA-seq as well as 10X, Salmon - a tool originally designed for bulk RNA-seq processing - has a submodule specifically designed for scRNA-seq called Alevin. For other scRNA-seq platforms - most often plate-based methods that demultiplex into a directory per well - methods first created for bulk RNA-seq such as Salmon, Kallisto, and STAR will work. In addition to the above, there also exist Bioconductor packages tailored for scRNA-seq processing within R. The scPipe package uses the Rsubread package under the hood to process droplet and plate-based protocols. In addition, the scruff Bioconductor package is especially designed for the processing of CEL-Seq/CEL-Seq2. One important note: some software such as Cell Ranger automatically filters cells silently based on quality control metrics such as via the “knee plot” method (aka barcode ranks, log-counts by log-rank). Such algorithmic filtering methods may not always work. Thus, we recommend forcing an expected number of cells to be output. In Cell Ranger, this takes the form of supplying the additional argument --force-cells. That way, you can determine your own filtering criteria and assess its efficacy, as well as perform analyses on ambient RNA using empty droplets present in your raw data. 5.3 Import to R In all the cases of above, the end result is a counts matrix of expression values. For the command line preprocessing methods, this matrix will need to be imported into R. This can be done with the help of DropletUtils (which directly creates a SingleCellExperiment object from 10X data via the read10xCounts() function), or tximeta/tximport. In cases where the counts matrix is not directly instantiated into a SingleCellExperiment class object, a basic one can be created manually. 5.4 Data Processing Once the scRNA-seq data has been imported into R and a SingleCellExperiment class object constructed, the next step is to create a clean expression matrix and fundamental dimensionality reduced representations of the data that can together be used in subsequent downstream analyses. 5.4.1 Quality Control Metrics Quality control metrics are utilized to assess not only the overall success of the experiment, but also to determine individual cell level reaction successes and failures. This step ultimately leads to the calculation of various quality control metrics, which can be used either to completely exclude poor-quality droplets/cells or be accounted for in downstream analyses. Some example metrics include total UMI counts, doublet identification, number of mitochondrial reads as a surrogate for cell damage, and complexity (number of genes assigned at least one read). 5.4.2 Normalizing Data Transforming the counts data into a normalized representation allows for cell and gene-specific biases to be eliminated prior to downstream analyses that depend on explicit gene expression value comparisons. This transformation is important for visualizing gene expression data across clusters (where cells may be of different sizes, e.g. have different library sizes) and for tasks such as differential expression analyses. 5.4.3 Feature Selection In most experiments, only a subset of genes drive observed heterogeneity across the population of cells profiled in an scRNA-seq experiment. The aim of performing feature selection is to both reduce computational overhead and increase statistical power in downstream analyses. While it is possible to employ supervised learning approaches in experiments with labeled cells (via an input of sorted populations or other markers), most scRNA-seq experiments do not have a priori knowledge on the identity of the cells. Thus, this necessitates unsupervised learning approaches to identify informative features. Metrics such as variance, deviance, and dropout are often used and fitted against gene expression to select for highly informative genes relative to their expression level. 5.4.4 Imputation Imputation methods have been proposed to address the challenge of the large amount of zeros observed in data from scRNA-seq. In general, these methods rely on inherent structure in the dataset. However, extra care should be taken in applying these methods, as imputation has been shown to generative false signals and decrease the reproducibility of cell-type specific markers. 5.4.5 Dimensionality Reduction While feature selection can ameliorate the complexity of scRNA-seq to some extent, it is often insufficient to make many analyses tractable. Dimensionality reduction can thus be applied to create low-dimensional representations that nonetheless preserve meaningful structure. Principal components analysis (PCA) often serves as the first step, calculating a large number of components which are then trimmed down to those that explain a high amount of variance. Following this, the PCA results serve as the basis for other dimensionality reduction approaches that are often used to visualize the data in 2 or 3-dimensions, including t-SNE, UMAP, and diffusion maps. Alternative, more statistically oriented approaches such as the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZiNB) transform may also be used to produce dimensionality reduced representations that account for confounding factors. 5.4.6 Integrating Datasets In cases where its necessary to bring together multiple distinct scRNA-seq experiments, a new avenue of approaches specifically designed to solve this problem by leveraging the richness inherent to this high-dimensional data have emerged. These new approaches specifically bypass the assumption required by traditional statistical models that the composition of the populations is either known or identical across batches, thus improving the end result of integration. Integration approaches provide a new (potentially dimensionality reduced) representation of the data that allows for the identification of biologically similar cells between batches. This improves the performance of clustering, annotation, and the consequently the interpretability of 2- or 3-dimensional visualizations. "],

The next chapter - “A Basic Analysis” - will provide more commentary on the various steps throughout, as well as relevant intermediate plotting results. Here, we use an example dataset from the Human Cell Atlas immune cell profiling project on bone marrow. This dataset is loaded via the HCAData package, which provides a ready to use SingleCellExperiment object. Note that the HCAData bone marrow dataset is comprised of 8 donors, so we have added an integration step to ameliorate batch effects caused by different donors. However, for use cases where integration is not necessary (e.g. no expected batch effects), we note in the code what to skip and relevant arguments to replace. Lastly, note that some arguments are added for the sake of reducing computational runtime and can be modified or removed. These include parallelization via BPPARAM, and different algorithms for SVD and nearest-neighbor via BSPARAM and BNPARAM. See the “Adaptations for Large-scale Data” chapter for more information on these arguments. 6.1 Code ## Setup --------------------------------------------------- ## not run - uncomment these lines to install necessary pkgs ## install.packages(&#39;BiocManager&#39;) ## BiocManager::install(version = &#39;devel&#39;) # devel=3.10 ## BiocManager::install(c( ## &#39;HCAData&#39;, # dataset ## &#39;scater&#39;, &#39;scran&#39;, &#39;batchelor&#39;, # processing + DE + batch correction ## &#39;igraph&#39;, # clustering ## &#39;slingshot&#39;, # Trajectory ## &#39;iSEE&#39;

Where relevant within each part of this basic workflow, we will refer the interested reader to the associated chapter to learn advanced or alternate ways of performing a given task. Put another way, the workflow demonstrated in this chapter is written with the aim of simplicity, and thus will likely require nontrivial tweaking of parameters or alternate methods in real-world analyses. One note: in this workflow, we will be loading libraries as they become necessary to clearly link libraries to their respective functions, which usually runs counter to the norm of loading libraries first, at the top of the analysis script. 7.1 Preprocessing &amp; Import to R We will assume here that sequencing alignment and quantification of the data into a counts matrix, as well as the subsequent import to R has already been performed since this is highly platform- or technology-dependent. Note that for 10X Genomics data (which is used in this example workflow), the counts matrix and associated metadata (cell barcodes, data path, etc.) can be imported via the DropletUtils package’s read10xCounts() function. For data processed through Salmon/Alevin/Kallisto, we recommend checking out the tximport/tximeta Bioconductor packages. These are either imported as SingleCellExperiment or as a counts matrix which can be then coerced into a SingleCellExperiment object as demonstrated below. 7.2 Constructing the SingleCellExperiment 7.2.1 From Scratch Below we show an example of creating a SingleCellExperiment class object from a counts matrix and associated experimental metadata. library(SingleCellExperiment) ## More realistic: read in your experimental design metadata ## If its per cell metadata, make sure it lines up with your ## counts matrix row IDs correctly ## my_metadata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;my_metadata.csv&quot;) ## Example data ncells &lt;- 100 my_counts_matrix &lt;- matrix(rpois(20000, 5), ncol = ncells) my_metadata &lt;- data.frame(genotype = rep(c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;), each = 50), experiment_id = &#39;Experiment1&#39;) ## Construct the sce object manually sce &lt;- SingleCellExperiment(assays = list(counts = my_counts_matrix), colData = my_metadata) ## Manually adding a variable that is the same across all cells colData(sce) &lt;- cbind(colData(sce), date = &#39;2020-01-01&#39;) sce ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 200 100 ## metadata(0): ## assays(1): counts ## rownames: NULL ## rowData names(0): ## colnames: NULL ## colData names(3): genotype experiment_id date ## reducedDimNames(0): ## spikeNames(0): ## altExpNames(0): 7.2.2 From Publicly Available Data From here on out, we will be working with a small example dataset from the TENxPBMCData Bioconductor package which has already been packaged into a SingleCellExperiment class object: library(TENxPBMCData) sce &lt;- TENxPBMCData(&#39;pbmc3k&#39;) sce ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 32738 2700 ## metadata(0): ## assays(1): counts ## rownames(32738): ENSG00000243485 ENSG00000237613 ... ## ENSG00000215616 ENSG00000215611 ## rowData names(3): ENSEMBL_ID Symbol_TENx Symbol ## colnames: NULL ## colData names(11): Sample Barcode ... Individual Date_published ## reducedDimNames(0): ## spikeNames(0): ## altExpNames(0): One decision that should be made early on in the analysis is what row identifier to identify genes. Depending on how the data is imported, the rowData component may already have additional annotation information, such as multiple row mappings. For our new sce object from the pbmc3k dataset, we can take a look at rowData to see our options: rowData(sce) ## DataFrame with 32738 rows and 3 columns ## ENSEMBL_ID Symbol_TENx Symbol ## &lt;character&gt; &lt;character&gt; &lt;character&gt; ## ENSG00000243485 ENSG00000243485 MIR1302-10 NA ## ENSG00000237613 ENSG00000237613 FAM138A FAM138A ## ENSG00000186092 ENSG00000186092 OR4F5 OR4F5 ## ENSG00000238009 ENSG00000238009 RP11-34P13.7 LOC100996442 ## ENSG00000239945 ENSG00000239945 RP11-34P13.8 NA ## ... ... ... ... ## ENSG00000215635 ENSG00000215635 AC145205.1 NA ## ENSG00000268590 ENSG00000268590 BAGE5 NA ## ENSG00000251180 ENSG00000251180 CU459201.1 NA ## ENSG00000215616 ENSG00000215616 AC002321.2 NA ## ENSG00000215611 ENSG00000215611 AC002321.1 NA ## &lt;character&gt; ## ENSG00000243485 ## ENSG00000237613 ## ENSG00000186092 ## ENSG00000238009 ## ENSG00000239945 ## ... ## ENSG00000215635 ## ENSG00000268590 ## ENSG00000251180 ## ENSG00000215616 ## ENSG00000215611 ## &lt;character&gt; ## MIR1302-10 ## FAM138A ## OR4F5 ## RP11-34P13.7 ## RP11-34P13.8 ## ... ## AC145205.1 ## BAGE5 ## CU459201.1 ## AC002321.2 ## AC002321.1 ## &lt;character&gt; ## NA ## FAM138A ## OR4F5 ## LOC100996442 ## NA ## ... ## NA ## NA ## NA ## NA ## NA We see that we could choose between ENSEMBL_ID (the default), Symbol_TENx, and Symbol. For ease of readability and subsetting, we will utilize the Symbol_TENx identifier as our object’s rownames, making it possible to subset the sce with gene symbols as in sce[&quot;CD8A&quot;, ]. ## reassign rownames rownames(sce) &lt;- rowData(sce)[, &quot;Symbol_TENx&quot;] Now, while this seems to work just fine, eventually we may run into an issue because we actually have duplicated row names here. Depending on how a downstream function is coded, this may cause an esoteric error to pop-up. In fact, here we have about 100 duplicates. We can avoid future errors (and many headaches) by removing duplicates before any analysis: ## counts dupes from top to bottom to make a logical vector dupes &lt;- duplicated(rownames(sce)) sce &lt;- sce[!dupes, ] Keep in mind, the above is likely the most inelegant solution to the problem. Other methods could include, from the duplicated set of genes, choosing the one with the highest expression, aggregating the counts per cell, or keeping them all by adding an additional suffix to make the row names unique. Each has its own tradeoffs, so we leave this choice up to the diligent reader. And one more bit of preprocessing to prevent a potential downstream error is to assign our columns proper names. We can grab the barcodes of each cell from colData and assign them as column names as follows: colnames(sce) &lt;- sce$Barcode 7.3 Data Processing The aim of this section is to form the basis for more interesting downstream analyses. Thus, the objective here is to transform the data into a “clean” expression matrix that has been normalized and freed of technical artifacts, as well as a dimensionality reduction representation that can be used in subsequent analyses and visualization. 7.3.1 Quality Control Metrics The first step is to ensure that our dataset only contains viable cells, e.g. droplets that contain proper mRNA libraries. One way to do that is to use the popular “knee plot”, which shows the relationship between the log rank vs the log total counts, and then calculate where the “knee” of the plot is. We use the DropletUtils package to demonstrate this in our example PBMC dataset. library(DropletUtils) ## Calculate the rank vs total counts per cell br &lt;- barcodeRanks(counts(sce)) ## Create the knee plot plot(log10(br$rank), log10(br$total)) abline(h = log10(metadata(br)$knee)) Figure 7.1: Barcode rank (aka knee) plot showing log10-rank by log10-total counts relationship and calculated knee (horizontal line). ## Save the calculated knee from `barcodeRanks()` knee &lt;- log10(metadata(br)$knee) We see that the knee calculated via this method (horizontal line) is at 1740, or on the log scale, 3.2405. This can be used as a filter to remove cells that are likely to be empty droplets. Before we do that, we will finish calculating other quality control (QC) metrics via the scater package and show the results from the first three cells. library(scater) sce &lt;- calculateQCMetrics(sce) We can display some of the calculated QC metrics appended to the colData component - there are a number of other columns present, but for brevity will only show two pertinent ones. colData(sce)[1:3, c(&quot;log10_total_features_by_counts&quot;, &quot;log10_total_counts&quot;)] ## DataFrame with 3 rows and 2 columns ## log10_total_features_by_counts log10_total_counts ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## AAACATACAACCAC-1 2.89 3.38 ## AAACATTGAGCTAC-1 3.13 3.69 ## AAACATTGATCAGC-1 3.05 3.5 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 2.89 ## 3.13 ## 3.05 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 3.38 ## 3.69 ## 3.5 We can further inspect these cells based on their total counts as well as vs the total features detected by counts (e.g. the number of genes that have nonzero counts). hist(sce$log10_total_counts, breaks = 100) abline(v = knee) Figure 7.2: Histogram of the log10 total counts with the calculated knee from above (vertical line). smoothScatter(sce$log10_total_counts, sce$log10_total_features_by_counts, nbin = 250) abline(v = knee) Figure 7.3: Smoothed scatter plot of the log10-total counts vs the log10-total features detected by counts with the calculated knee from above (vertical line). While there are various ways to filter cells, here we actually will not need to perform any filtering, as the data has already undergone a stringent quality control, and thus all the cells can be considered high quality. For the sake of completeness, we will demonstrate here - without evaluating - how to subset based on the previously calculated barcode ranks knee: ## not run sce &lt;- sce[, sce$log10_total_counts &gt; knee] 7.3.2 Normalizing Data Next up we will transform the primary data, the counts, into a (log) normalized version. In this section, we will use the scran package throughout. First however, we will need to calculate scaling factors per cell. This function relies on an initial “quick and dirty” clustering to get roughly similar pools of cells. These are used to generate pool-based estimates, from which the subsequent cell-based size factors are generated. To learn more about the method, see the ?computeSumFactors documentation. For now, we will perform a simpler normalization, using the library sizes per cell to create a log-normalized expression matrix: sce &lt;- scater::normalize(sce) We can see below that we now have two assays, counts and logcounts. assays(sce) ## List of length 2 ## names(2): counts logcounts 7.3.3 Feature Selection This section will use the scran package, as we select for informative genes by selecting for those with high coefficients of biological variation. Since this experiment does not have spike-ins, we will fit the mean-variance trend across the endogenous genes. library(scran) fit &lt;- trendVar(sce, use.spikes = FALSE) plot(fit$mean, fit$var) curve(fit$trend(x), col = &#39;red&#39;, lwd = 2, add = TRUE) Figure 7.4: Mean-variance trend line fit by scran package trendVar() function. We can see that the trend line goes through the central mass of genes, and thus continue on with looking at the decomposed variance. In this method, it is assumed that the total variance is the sum of the technical and biological variance, where the technical variance can be determined by interpolating the fitted trend at the mean log-count for that gene. Thus the biological variance is the total variance minus this interpolated (technical) variance. We can then rank and choose genes which have a biological coefficient of variance greater than zero. dec &lt;- decomposeVar(sce, fit) dec &lt;- dec[order(dec$bio, decreasing = TRUE), ] # order by bio var dec[1:5, ] ## mean total bio tech p.value FDR ## LYZ 1.629 3.925 3.116 0.809 0 0 ## S100A9 1.068 3.352 2.628 0.725 0 0 ## HLA-DRA 1.543 3.071 2.278 0.793 0 0 ## FTL 3.637 2.941 2.203 0.738 0 0 ## CD74 2.209 2.696 1.900 0.796 0 0 The total number of genes with biological variance greater than zero as 3770. Alternatively, we could use the p-value/FDR as a way to rank our genes, but do note the following (from the simpleSingleCell vignette: “Ranking based on p-value tends to prioritize HVGs that are more likely to be true positives but, at the same time, less likely to be interesting. This is because the ratio can be very large for HVGs that have very low total variance and do not contribute much to the cell-cell heterogeneity.” However we choose, we can save these highly variable genes and use them for subsequent analyses: hvg_genes &lt;- rownames(dec)[dec$bio &gt; 0] For the purpose of sharing and saving this list of genes, we can stash the result into the metadata component of our sce object as follows: metadata(sce)$hvg_genes &lt;- hvg_genes metadata(sce)$hvg_genes[1:10] ## [1] &quot;LYZ&quot; &quot;S100A9&quot; &quot;HLA-DRA&quot; &quot;FTL&quot; &quot;CD74&quot; &quot;CST3&quot; &quot;S100A8&quot; ## [8] &quot;TYROBP&quot; &quot;NKG7&quot; &quot;FTH1&quot; The metadata component can hold any object, as it is a list container. Any results that you’d like to keep are safe to store here, and a great way to save or share intermediate results that would otherwise be kept in separate objects. 7.3.4 Dimensionality Reduction We now can perform dimensionality reduction using our highly variable genes (hvg_genes) subset. To do this, we will first calculate the PCA representation via the runPCA() function from the scater package. We will calculate 50 components on our highly variable genes: sce &lt;- runPCA(sce, ncomponents = 50, feature_set = hvg_genes) The results of these calculations will be stored in the reducedDims component. This method saves the percent variance explained per component as an attribute, which can be accessed as follows, and subsequently plot the “elbow plot”: ## access the attribute where percentVar is saved in reducedDim pct_var_explained &lt;- attr(reducedDim(sce, &#39;PCA&#39;), &#39;percentVar&#39;) plot(pct_var_explained) # elbow plot To calculate a 2-dimensional representation of the data, we will use the top 20 components of our PCA result to compute the UMAP representation. sce &lt;- runUMAP(sce, use_dimred = &#39;PCA&#39;, n_dimred = 20) plotUMAP(sce) Figure 7.5: UMAP plot. With that, we have a canvas on which to paint our downstream analyses. 7.4 Downstream Statistical Analyses There are a plethora of potential downstream analyses to run, the choice of which is highly dependent on the biological objective. For this example dataset, our aim will be to identify the key cell types via a combination of clustering and differential expression. 7.4.1 Clustering Based on our earlier UMAP plot, it appears that we have a few distinct clusters. To do this computationally, we can utilize the scran package to: build a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph calculate based on the SNN graph the most representative clusters In this first step, we will specify that we will consider k nearest neighbors, and d dimensions from the PCA calculation as follows: set.seed(1234) # to make results reproducible snng &lt;- buildSNNGraph(sce, k = 50, d = 20) Following the graph construction, we can calculate the clusters using a variety of different graph-based methods from the igraph package. Here, we use the louvain method to determine our cell’s cluster memberships. snng_clusters &lt;- igraph::cluster_louvain(snng) We see that we have the following numbers of cells per cluster: table(snng_clusters$membership) ## ## 1 2 3 4 5 ## 687 350 556 528 579 To view this result graphically on the UMAP plot, we first assign the result to the colData component as a new column, and specify this as our color variable in the plotUMAP() function: colData(sce)$clusters &lt;- as.factor(snng_clusters$membership) plotUMAP(sce, colour_by = &#39;clusters&#39;) Figure 7.6: UMAP plot showing calculated clusters. Naturally, this result will change as we tweak the number of k neighbors to consider and with the specific clustering algorithm, but for now we will go onwards to find markers of each of our clusters. 7.4.2 Differential Expression In this section, we will look to identify genes that are unique to each of our clusters. To accomplish this, we will lean on the scran package to perform the analysis, and then the scater package to visualize the results. For this analysis, we will limit ourselves to a top subset of highly variable genes in our hvg_genes set, purely for the sake of computation time. Furthermore, we will limit our consideration to genes with an increased log fold-change of at least 1.5 versus other clusters. We will also use the BiocParallel package to parallelize the computation and speed up our processing via the BPPARAM argument. markers &lt;- findMarkers(sce, clusters = colData(sce)$clusters, subset.row = hvg_genes[1:250], lfc = 1.5, direction = &#39;up&#39;, log.p = TRUE, BPPARAM = BiocParallel::MulticoreParam()) We can view the top 5 markers that are differentially expressed (by our specified metrics): markers[[1]][1:5, ] ## Top log.p.value log.FDR logFC.2 logFC.3 logFC.4 logFC.5 ## CST3 1 -831.4 -825.9 3.446 3.470 3.413 3.480 ## TYROBP 1 -778.7 -773.8 3.325 3.324 2.691 3.301 ## LYZ 2 -526.9 -522.8 4.028 4.011 4.072 4.000 ## FTL 3 -667.3 -662.9 3.110 3.634 3.463 3.534 ## FTH1 4 -474.3 -470.6 2.771 3.118 3.100 2.755 We can see that CD3D, a marker of T cells, is one of our top differentially expressed genes in cluster 1. We can plot the expression of this gene across all our clusters as follows: plotExpression(sce, &#39;CD3D&#39;, x = &#39;clusters&#39;) Figure 7.7: Violin plots of CD3D expression across clusters. This plot highlights that CD3D is more highly expressed in cluster 1 relative to some of the other clusters, but not all. This can also be seen from our raw output above, where the log fold-change is calculated with respect to each cluster. There, we see that the log fold-change for CD3D is very high only relative to clusters 2 and 3 (meeting our cutoff of 1.5). 7.4.3 Annotation 7.4.3.1 A Manual Approach To finish off our the downstream analysis section here, we will look to annotate our clusters with a cell type designation, based on publicly available knowledge. Before we do that, let’s get a broader view of our top differentially expressed genes. To do this, we can iterate over the list-object returned by findMarkers to get the top 10 genes per cluster, and then plot these genes in a heatmap. ## grab the top 10 genes per cluster (e.g. within each list component) genes &lt;- lapply(markers, function(x) { rownames(x)[x$Top &lt;= 10] }) ## uniqify the set of genes returned, after coercing to a vector genes &lt;- unique(unlist(genes)) plotHeatmap(sce, genes, colour_columns_by = &quot;clusters&quot;, show_colnames = FALSE, clustering_method = &#39;ward.D2&#39;, fontsize_row = 6) Figure 7.8: Heatmap showing top differentially expressed genes across the clusters. Based on the heatmap output (and a priori knowledge), we can make some observations: CD79A/CD79B, markers of B cells, are uniquely and highly expressed in cluster 2 HLA genes, present on antigen presenting cells (APCs), are highly expressed across clusters 2 and 3 LYZ, a marker of dendritic cells (an APC), is highly expressed in cluster 3 Granzymes A and B (GZMA/GZMB), and NKG7, markers of cytotoxic cells such as CD8s and NK cells, are highly expressed within (a subset of cluster 4) CD3D/CD3E, markers of T cells, are expressed across clusters 5, 1, and 4 Finally, we can view a selection of the genes mentioned above on our previous UMAP plot: plotUMAP(sce, colour_by = &quot;CD79A&quot;) Figure 7.9: Various UMAP plots showing the expression of select cell-type specific genes. plotUMAP(sce, colour_by = &quot;LYZ&quot;) Figure 7.10: Various UMAP plots showing the expression of select cell-type specific genes. plotUMAP(sce, colour_by = &quot;NKG7&quot;) Figure 7.11: Various UMAP plots showing the expression of select cell-type specific genes. plotUMAP(sce, colour_by = &quot;CD3D&quot;) Figure 7.12: Various UMAP plots showing the expression of select cell-type specific genes. Combining the information derived from our heatmap and viewing these genes on our UMAP, we can come to the following conclusion: Cluster 2 is likely to be B cells Cluster 3 is likely to be dendritic cells Clusters 1, 5, 4 appear to represent a spectrum of cells with cytotoxic capabilities, likely composed of a combination of T cells and NK cells, Cluster 4 exhibits an strong NK cell signature on the basis of NKG7 Now that we’ve manually sorted our dataset on the basis of prior knowledge, let’s try a more automated approach using publicly available markers. 7.5 Accessible &amp; Reproducible Analysis In collaborative settings, it is essential to share data and analyses. Thanks to the SingleCellExperiment class, most of if not all analysis steps performed can be recorded. These outputs are accessible through not only R, but also via graphical user interfaces as well that broaden the potential viewing audience. 7.5.1 Interactive Data Visualization Interactive exploration and visualization is a great way for collaborators to learn more about scRNA-seq data and analyses. In particular the iSEE package has been especially designed for viewing and sharing scRNA-seq. ## not run library(iSEE) iSEE(sce) Based on the example analyses, we task the interested reader to assess the previous section’s automatic annotation relative to the clustering results using iSEE.

These usually manifest as “cells” with low total counts, few expressed genes and high mitochondrial or spike-in proportions. These low-quality libraries are problematic as they can contribute to misleading results in downstream analyses: They form their own distinct cluster(s), complicating interpretation of the results. This can be most obviously driven by increased mitochondrial proportions or enrichment for nuclear RNAs after cell damage. However, very small libraries can also form their own clusters due to shifts in the mean upon transformation (Lun 2018). They contain genes that appear to be strongly “upregulated” due to aggressive scaling to normalize for small library sizes. This is most problematic for contaminating transcripts (e.g., from the ambient solution) that are present in all libraries at low but constant levels. Increased scaling in low-quality libraries transforms small counts for these transcripts in large normalized expression values, resulting in apparent upregulation compared to other cells. They distort the characterization of population heterogeneity during variance estimation or principal components analysis. The first few principal components will capture differences in quality rather than biology, reducing the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction. Similarly, genes with the largest variances will be driven by differences between low- and high-quality cells. To avoid - or at least mitigate - these problems, we need to remove these cells at the start of the analysis. This step is commonly referred to as quality control (QC) on the cells. (We will use “library” and “cell” rather interchangeably here, though the distinction will become important when dealing with droplet-based data.) We will demonstrate using a small scRNA-seq dataset from A. T. L. Lun et al. (2017), which is provided with no prior QC so that we can apply our own procedures.

These metrics are described below in terms of reads for SMART-seq2 data, but the same definitions apply to UMI data generated by other technologies like MARS-seq and droplet-based protocols. The library size is defined as the total sum of counts across all relevant features for each cell. Here, we will consider the relevant features to be the endogenous genes. Cells with small library sizes are of low quality as the RNA has been lost at some point during library preparation, either due to cell lysis or inefficient cDNA capture and amplification. The number of expressed features in each cell is defined as the number of endogenous genes with non-zero counts for that cell. Any cell with very few expressed genes is likely to be of poor quality as the diverse transcript population has not been successfully captured. The proportion of reads mapped to spike-in transcripts is calculated relative to the total count across all features (including spike-ins) for each cell. As the same amount of spike-in RNA should have been added to each cell, any enrichment in spike-in counts is symptomatic of loss of endogenous RNA. Thus, high proportions are indicative of poor-quality cells where endogenous RNA has been lost due to, e.g., partial cell lysis or RNA degradation during dissociation. In the absence of spike-in transcripts, the proportion of reads mapped to genes in the mitochondrial genome can be used. High proportions are indicative of poor-quality cells (Islam et al. 2014; Ilicic et al. 2016), possibly because of loss of cytoplasmic RNA from perforated cells. The reasoning is that mitochondria are larger than individual transcript molecules and less likely to escape through holes in the cell membrane. For each cell, we calculate these QC metrics using the perCellQCMetrics() function from the scater package (McCarthy et al. 2017). The sum column contains the total count for each cell, the detected column contains the number of detected genes, subsets_Mito_percent contains the percentage of reads mapped to mitochondrial transcripts (based on Ensembl annotation) and altexps_ERCC_percent contains the percentage of reads mapped to ERCC transcripts. # Identifying the mitochondrial transcripts: library(AnnotationHub) ens.mm.v97 &lt;- AnnotationHub()[[&quot;AH73905&quot;]] location &lt;- mapIds(ens.mm.v97, keys=rownames(sce.416b), keytype=&quot;GENEID&quot;, column=&quot;SEQNAME&quot;) is.mito &lt;- which(location==&quot;MT&quot;) # Computing the QC metrics. library(scater) df &lt;- perCellQCMetrics(sce.416b, subsets=list(Mito=is.mito)) df ## DataFrame with 192 rows and 16 columns ## sum detected percent_top_50 percent_top_100 percent_top_200 ## &lt;integer&gt;

For example, we might discard all cells that have library sizes below 100,000 reads; express fewer than 5,000 genes; have spike-in proportions above 10%; or have mitochondrial proportions above 10%1. qc.lib &lt;- df$sum &lt; 1e5 qc.nexprs &lt;- df$detected &lt; 5e3 qc.spike &lt;- df$altexps_ERCC_percent &gt; 10 qc.mito &lt;- df$subsets_Mito_percent &gt; 10 discard &lt;- qc.lib | qc.nexprs | qc.spike | qc.mito # Summarize the number of cells removed for each reason. DataFrame(LibSize=sum(qc.lib), NExprs=sum(qc.nexprs), SpikeProp=sum(qc.spike), MitoProp=sum(qc.mito), Total=sum(discard)) ## DataFrame with 1 row and 5 columns ## LibSize NExprs SpikeProp MitoProp Total ## &lt;integer&gt; &lt;integer&gt; &lt;integer&gt; &lt;integer&gt; &lt;integer&gt; ## 1 3 0 19 14 33 ## &lt;integer&gt; ## 3 ## &lt;integer&gt; ## 0 ## &lt;integer&gt; ## 19 ## &lt;integer&gt; ## 14 ## &lt;integer&gt; ## 33 # Retain only high-quality cells in the SingleCellExperiment. filtered &lt;- sce.416b[,!discard] dim(filtered) ## [1] 46604 159 While simple, this strategy generally requires considerable experience to determine appropriate thresholds for each experimental protocol and biological system. For example, thresholds for read count-based data are simply not applicable for UMI-based data, and vice versa. Indeed, even with the same protocol and system, the appropriate threshold can vary from run to run due to the vagaries of cDNA capture efficiency and sequencing depth. 8.3.2 With adaptive thresholds To obtain an adaptive threshold, we assume that most of the dataset consists of high-quality cells. We then identify cells that are outliers for the various QC metrics, based on the median absolute deviation (MAD) from the median value of each metric across all cells. Specifically, a value is considered an outlier if it is more than 3 MADs from the median in the “problematic” direction. This is loosely motivated by the fact that such a filter will retain 99% of non-outlier values that follow a normal distribution. For the 416B data, we identify cells with log-transformed library sizes that are more than 3 MADs below the median. A log-transformation is used to improve resolution at small values when type=&quot;lower&quot;. In particular, it guarantees that the threshold is not a negative value, which would be meaningless for quality control on these metrics. Moreover, these metrics can occasionally exhibit a heavy right tail, and the log-transformation makes the distribution seem more normal to justify the 99% rationale mentioned above. qc.lib2 &lt;- isOutlier(df$sum, log=TRUE, nmads=3, type=&quot;lower&quot;) We do the same for the log-transformed number of expressed genes. qc.nexprs2 &lt;- isOutlier(df$detected, nmads=3, log=TRUE, type=&quot;lower&quot;) isOutlier() will also return the exact filter thresholds for each metric. These is useful for checking whether the automatically selected thresholds are appropriate. attr(qc.lib2, &quot;thresholds&quot;) ## lower higher ## 434083 Inf attr(qc.nexprs2, &quot;thresholds&quot;) ## lower higher ## 5231 Inf We identify outliers for the proportion-based metrics in a similar manner. Here, no transformation is required as we are identifying large outliers that should already be clearly distinguishable from zero. qc.spike2 &lt;- isOutlier(df$altexps_ERCC_percent, nmads=3, type=&quot;higher&quot;) qc.mito2 &lt;- isOutlier(df$subsets_Mito_percent, nmads=3, type=&quot;higher&quot;) A cell that is an outlier for any of these metrics is considered to be of low-quality and discarded. discard2 &lt;- qc.lib2 | qc.nexprs2 | qc.spike2 | qc.mito2 # Summarize the number of cells removed for each reason.

This is a convenient wrapper function that simply calls isOutlier() with the settings demonstrated above. reasons &lt;- quickCellQC(df, percent_subsets=c(&quot;subsets_Mito_percent&quot;, &quot;altexps_ERCC_percent&quot;), nmads=3) colSums(as.matrix(reasons)) ## low_lib_size low_n_features ## 4 0 ## high_subsets_Mito_percent high_altexps_ERCC_percent ## 2 1 ## discard ## 6 The actual filtering is achieved simply by subsetting the SingleCellExperiment as previously shown. filtered2 &lt;- sce.416b[,!discard2] With this strategy, the thresholds adapt to both the location and spread of the distribution of values for a given metric. This allows the QC procedure to adjust to changes in sequencing depth, cDNA capture efficiency, mitochondrial content, etc. without requiring any user intervention or prior experience. However, it does require some implicit assumptions that are discussed below in more detail. 8.3.3 Considering experimental factors More complex studies may involve batches of cells generated at different times or in different systems. In such cases, the adaptive strategy should be applied to each batch separately. It makes little sense to compute medians and MADs from a mixture distribution containing samples from multiple batches. For example, if the sequencing coverage is lower in one batch compared to the others, it will drag down the median and inflate the MAD. This will reduce the suitability of the adaptive threshold for the other batches. If each batch is represented by its own SingleCellExperiment, the isOutlier() function can be directly applied to each batch as shown above. However, if cells from all batches have been merged into a single SingleCellExperiment, the batch= argument should be used to ensure that outliers are identified within each batch. This allows isOutlier() to accommodate systematic differences in the QC metrics across batches. We will again illustrate using the 416B dataset, which actually contains two experimental factors - plate of origin and oncogene induction status. (We had been ignoring this in the previous section for simplicity, but no longer.) We combine these factors together and use this in the batch= argument to isOutlier() via quickCellQC(). This results in the removal of more cells as the MAD is no longer inflated by (i) systematic differences in sequencing depth between batches and (ii) differences in number of genes expressed upon oncogene induction. batch &lt;- paste0(sce.416b$phenotype, &quot;-&quot;, sce.416b$Plate) batch.reasons &lt;- quickCellQC(df, percent_subsets=c(&quot;subsets_Mito_percent&quot;, &quot;altexps_ERCC_percent&quot;), nmads=3, batch=batch) colSums(as.matrix(batch.reasons)) ## low_lib_size low_n_features ## 4 2 ## high_subsets_Mito_percent high_altexps_ERCC_percent ## 2 4 ## discard ## 7 # Retain only high-quality cells in the SingleCellExperiment. filtered3 &lt;- sce.416b[,!batch.reasons$discard] 8.4 Checking diagnostic plots TODO. 8.5 Droplet-specific procedures 8.5.1 Background An interesting aspect of droplet-based data is that we have no prior knowledge about whether a particular library (i.e., cell barcode) corresponds to cell-containing or empty droplets. Thus, we need to call cells from empty droplets based on the observed expression profiles. This is not entirely straightforward as empty droplets can contain ambient (i.e., extracellular) RNA that can be captured and sequenced, resulting in non-zero counts for libraries that do not contain any cell. To demonstrate, we obtain the unfiltered count matrix for the PBMC dataset from 10X Genomics. This has not been subjected to the cell filtering algorithm method in the CellRanger software suite, allowing us to apply our own algorithms for identifying the libraries that correspond to cells. # Hoping to shovel this code into TENxPBMCData. # Just bear with it for now. library(BiocFileCache) bfc &lt;- BiocFileCache(&quot;raw_data&quot;, ask = FALSE) raw.path &lt;- bfcrpath(bfc, file.path(&quot;http://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples&quot;, &quot;cell-exp/2.1.0/pbmc4k/pbmc4k_raw_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz&quot;)) untar(raw.path, exdir=file.path(tempdir(), &quot;pbmc4k&quot;)) library(DropletUtils) library(Matrix) fname &lt;- file.path(tempdir(), &quot;pbmc4k/raw_gene_bc_matrices/GRCh38&quot;) sce.pbmc &lt;- read10xCounts(fname, col.names=TRUE) sce.pbmc ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 33694 737280 ## metadata(0): ## assays(1): counts ## rownames(33694): ENSG00000243485 ENSG00000237613 ... ## ENSG00000277475 ENSG00000268674 ## rowData names(2): ID Symbol ## colnames(737280): AAACCTGAGAAACCAT-1 AAACCTGAGAAACCGC-1 ... ## TTTGTCATCTTTAGTC-1 TTTGTCATCTTTCCTC-1 ## colData names(2): Sample Barcode ## reducedDimNames(0): ## spikeNames(0): ## altExpNames(0): The distribution of total counts exhibits a sharp transition between barcodes with large and small total counts (Figure 8.1), probably corresponding to cell-containing and empty droplets respectively. bcrank &lt;- barcodeRanks(counts(sce.pbmc)) # Only showing unique points for plotting speed. uniq &lt;- !duplicated(bcrank$rank) plot(bcrank$rank[uniq], bcrank$total[uniq], log=&quot;xy&quot;, xlab=&quot;Rank&quot;, ylab=&quot;Total UMI count&quot;, cex.lab=1.2) abline(h=metadata(bcrank)$inflection, col=&quot;darkgreen&quot;, lty=2) abline(h=metadata(bcrank)$knee, col=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;, lty=2) legend(&quot;bottomleft&quot;, legend=c(&quot;Inflection&quot;, &quot;Knee&quot;), col=c(&quot;darkgreen&quot;, &quot;dodgerblue&quot;), lty=2, cex=1.2) Figure 8.1: Total UMI count for each barcode in the PBMC dataset, plotted against its rank (in decreasing order of total counts). The inferred locations of the inflection and knee points are also shown. 8.5.2 Testing for empty droplets We use the emptyDrops() function to test whether the expression profile for each cell barcode is significantly different from the ambient RNA pool (Lun et al. 2019). Any significant deviation indicates that the barcode corresponds to a cell-containing droplet. We call cells at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1%, meaning that no more than 0.1% of our called barcodes should be empty droplets on average. set.seed(100) e.out &lt;- emptyDrops(counts(sce.pbmc)) sum(e.out$FDR &lt;= 0.001, na.rm=TRUE) ## [1] 4233 emptyDrops() computes Monte Carlo \\(p\\)-values based on a Dirichlet-multinomial model of sampling molecules into droplets. These \\(p\\)-values are stochastic so it is important to set the random seed to obtain reproducible results. The stability of the Monte Carlo \\(p\\)-values depends on the number of iterations used to compute them. This is controlled using the niters= argument in emptyDrops(), set to a default of 10000 for speed. Larger values improve stability with the only cost being that of time, so users should set niters= to the largest value they are willing to wait for. emptyDrops() assumes that libraries with total UMI counts below a certain threshold (lower=100 by default) correspond to empty droplets. These are used to estimate the ambient expression profile against which the remaining libraries are tested. Under this definition, these low-count libraries cannot be cell-containing droplets and are excluded from the hypothesis testing - hence the NAs in the output of the function. To retain only the detected cells, we subset our SingleCellExperiment object. Discerning readers will notice the use of which(), which conveniently removes the NAs prior to the subsetting. # using which() to automatically remove NAs. sce.pbmc &lt;- sce.pbmc[,which(e.out$FDR &lt;= 0.001)] Users wanting to use the cell calling algorithm from the CellRanger pipeline (version 2) can call defaultDrops() instead. This tends to be quite conservative as it often discards genuine cells with low RNA content (and thus low total counts). It also requires an a priori estimate of the expected number of cells in the experiment, which may or may not be accurate. (As an aside, CellRanger version 3 automatically performs cell calling using an algorithm similar to emptyDrops(). If we had started our analysis with the filtered count matrix, we would not need to run emptyDrops() manually as shown here. Nonetheless, it may be desirable on occasions where more detailed inspection or control of the cell-calling statistics is desired.) 8.5.3 Examining cell-calling diagnostics The number of Monte Carlo iterations determines the lower bound for the \\(p\\)-values (Phipson and Smyth 2010). The Limited field in the output indicates whether or not the computed \\(p\\)-value for a particular barcode is bounded by the number of iterations. If any non-significant barcodes are TRUE for Limited, we may need to increase the number of iterations. A larger number of iterations will result in a lower \\(p\\)-value for these barcodes, which may allow them to be detected after correcting for multiple testing. table(Sig=e.out$FDR &lt;= 0.001, Limited=e.out$Limited) ## Limited ## Sig FALSE TRUE ## FALSE 1056 0 ## TRUE 1661 2572 As mentioned above, emptyDrops() assumes that barcodes with low total UMI counts are empty droplets. Thus, the null hypothesis should be true for all of these barcodes. We can check whether the hypothesis testing procedure holds its size by examining the distribution of \\(p\\)-values for low-total barcodes with test.ambient=TRUE. Ideally, the distribution should be close to uniform. full.data &lt;- read10xCounts(fname, col.names=TRUE) set.seed(100) limit &lt;- 100 all.out &lt;- emptyDrops(counts(full.data), lower=limit, test.ambient=TRUE) hist(all.out$PValue[all.out$Total &lt;= limit &amp; all.out$Total &gt; 0], xlab=&quot;P-value&quot;, main=&quot;&quot;, col=&quot;grey80&quot;) Figure 8.2: Distribution of \\(p\\)-values for the assumed empty droplets. Large peaks near zero indicate that barcodes with total counts below lower are not all ambient in origin. This can be resolved by decreasing lower further to ensure that barcodes corresponding to droplets with very small cells are not used to estimate the ambient profile. While emptyDrops() will distinguish cells from empty droplets, it makes no statement about the quality of the cells. It is entirely possible for droplets to contain damaged or dying cells, which need to be removed prior to downstream analysis. This can be done using the outlier-based strategy to set data-adaptive thresholds on the mitochondrial proportion. (emptyDrops() will already remove cells with low library sizes or number of expressed genes, so further filtering on these metrics is generally not necessary.) 8.6 Assumptions of outlier detection 8.6.1 Overview The use of isOutlier() (Section 8.3.2) is a general and effective strategy for identifying and removing low-quality cells. However, it involves a number of assumptions about the experiment and biological system, and while these assumptions are mostly reasonable, users should still keep them in mind when interpreting the results2. An outlier-based definition for low-quality cells assumes that most cells are of acceptable quality. This is usually a reasonable expectation and can be experimentally supported in some situations by visually checking that the cells are intact, e.g., on the microwell plate. If most cells are of (unacceptably) low quality, the adaptive thresholds will fail as they cannot remove the majority of cells. Of course, what is acceptable or not is in the eye of the beholder - neurons, for example, are notoriously difficult to dissociate, and we would often retain cells in a neuronal scRNA-seq dataset with QC metrics that would be unacceptable in a more amenable system like embryonic stem cells. Another assumption is that the QC metrics are independent of the biological state of each cell. This implies that any outlier values for these metrics are driven by technical factors rather than biological processes. Thus, removing cells based on the metrics will not misrepresent the biology in downstream analyses. This assumption is most likely to be violated in highly heterogeneous cell populations. For example, some cell types may naturally have less RNA or express fewer genes than other cell types. These cell types are more likely to be considered outliers and removed, even if they are of high quality. QC filtering based on outliers may not be appropriate in such cases. The use of the MAD mitigates this problem by accounting for biological variability in the QC metrics. A heterogeneous population should have higher variability in the metrics among high-quality cells, increasing the MAD and reducing the chance of incorrectly removing particular cell types (at the cost of reducing power to remove low-quality cells). Systematic differences in the QC metrics can be handled to some extent using the batch= argument in the isOutlier() function. However, this is not applicable in experiments where the relevant factors (e.g., cell type) are not known in advance. 8.6.2 Checking for discarded cell types The biggest practical concern with the assumptions is whether a cell type is lost during the QC procedure. We can diagnose this by looking for differences in gene expression between the discarded and retained cells. To demonstrate, we compute the average count across the discarded and retained pools in the 416B data set, and we compute the log-fold change between the averages. lost &lt;- calculateAverage(counts(sce.416b)[,!discard]) kept &lt;- calculateAverage(counts(sce.416b)[,discard]) library(edgeR) logged &lt;- cpm(cbind(lost, kept), log=TRUE, prior.count=2) logFC &lt;- logged[,1] - logged[,2] abundance &lt;- rowMeans(logged) If the discarded pool is enriched for a certain cell type, we should observe increased expression of the corresponding marker genes. No systematic upregulation of genes is apparent in the discarded pool in Figure 8.3, suggesting that the QC step did not inadvertently filter out a cell type in the 416B dataset. plot(abundance, logFC, xlab=&quot;Average count&quot;, ylab=&quot;Log-FC (lost/kept)&quot;, pch=16) points(abundance[is.mito], logFC[is.mito], col=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;, pch=16) Figure 8.3: Log-fold change in expression in the discarded cells compared to the retained cells in the 416B dataset. Each point represents a gene with mitochondrial transcripts in blue. For comparison, let’s pretend that we applied a fixed threshold on the library size to filter cells in the PBMC data set. Specifically, we remove all libraries with a library size below 500. alt.discard &lt;- colSums(counts(sce.pbmc)) &lt; 500 lost &lt;- calculateAverage(counts(sce.pbmc)[,alt.discard]) kept &lt;- calculateAverage(counts(sce.pbmc)[,!alt.discard]) logged &lt;- edgeR::cpm(cbind(lost, kept), log=TRUE, prior.count=2) logFC &lt;- logged[,1] - logged[,2] abundance &lt;- rowMeans(logged) The presence of a distinct population in the discarded pool manifests in Figure 8.4 as a set of genes that are strongly upregulated in lost. This includes PF4, PPBP and CAVIN2, which (spoiler alert!) indicates that there is a platelet population that has been discarded by alt.discard. plot(abundance, logFC, xlab=&quot;Average count&quot;, ylab=&quot;Log-FC (lost/kept)&quot;, pch=16) platelet &lt;- c(&quot;PF4&quot;, &quot;PPBP&quot;, &quot;CAVIN2&quot;) library(org.Hs.eg.db) ids &lt;- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys=platelet, column=&quot;ENSEMBL&quot;, keytype=&quot;SYMBOL&quot;) points(abundance[ids], logFC[ids], col=&quot;orange&quot;, pch=16) Figure 8.4: Average counts across all discarded and retained cells in the PBMC dataset, after using a more stringent filter on the total UMI count. Each point represents a gene, with platelet-related genes highlighted in orange. If we suspect that cell types have been incorrectly discarded by our QC procedure, the most direct solution is to relax the QC filters by increasing nmads= in the isOutlier() calls. We can also avoid filtering on metrics that are associated with genuine biological differences between cell types. As an aside, it is worth mentioning that the true technical quality of a cell may also be correlated with its type. (This differs from a correlation between the cell type and the QC metrics, as the latter are our imperfect proxies for quality.) This can arise if some cell types are not amenable to dissociation or microfluidics handling during the scRNA-seq protocol. In such cases, it is possible to “correctly” discard an entire cell type during QC if all of its cells are damaged. Indeed, concerns over the computational removal of cell types during QC are probably minor compared to losses in the experimental protocol.

This typically arises from differences in cDNA capture or PCR amplification efficiency across cells, attributable to the difficulty of achieving consistent library preparation with minimal starting material3. Normalization aims to remove these systematic differences such that they do not interfere with comparisons of the expression profiles between cells, e.g., during clustering or differential expression analyses. At this point, it is worth being clear on what we mean by “systematic differences”. For the purposes of this chaper, systematic differences refer to biases that affect all genes in a similar manner. This includes, for example, a change in sequencing depth that scales the expected coverage of all genes by a certain factor. One can also consider more complex scaling effects, e.g., with respect to gene abundance, which would require non-linear normalization methods reminiscent of microarray4 analyses. In contrast, general batch correction methods aim to remove gene-specific differences between batches that may not follow any predictable pattern across genes, and thus will not be considered in this chapter. 9.2 Setting up the data To demonstrate a range of normalization strategies in this section, we will be using the Zeisel et al. (2015) dataset from the scRNAseq package. This dataset was generated using the STRT/C1 protocol and contains UMI count data for 3005 cells from the mouse brain. ERCC spike-in transcripts were also added to each cell. For the sake of brevity, we will trust that sufficient quality control on the cells has already been performed by the original authors. library(scRNAseq) sce.zeisel &lt;- ZeiselBrainData() sce.zeisel ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 20006 3005 ## metadata(0): ## assays(1): counts ## rownames(20006): Tspan12 Tshz1 ... mt-Rnr1 mt-Nd4l ## rowData names(1): featureType ## colnames(3005): 1772071015_C02 1772071017_G12 ... 1772066098_A12 ## 1772058148_F03 ## colData names(10): tissue group # ... level1class level2class ## reducedDimNames(0): ## spikeNames(0): ## altExpNames(2): ERCC repeat 9.3 Library size normalization Scaling normalization is the simplest and most commonly used class of normalization strategies. This involves dividing all counts for each cell by a cell-specific scaling factor, often called a “size factor”. The assumption here is that any cell-specific bias (e.g., in capture or amplification efficiency) affects all genes equally via scaling of the expected mean count for that cell. The size factor for each cell represents the estimate of the relative bias in that cell, so division of its counts by its size factor should remove that bias. The resulting “normalized expression values” can then be used for downstream analyses such as clustering and dimensionality reduction. Library size normalization is the simplest strategy for performing scaling normalization. We define the library size as the total sum of counts across all genes for each cell. The “library size factor” for each cell is then directly proportional to its library size, where the proportionality constant is defined such that the mean size factor across all cells is equal to 1. This ensures that the normalized expression values are on the same scale as the original counts, which is useful for interpretation - especially when dealing with transformed data (see Section 9.7). library(scater) lib.sf.zeisel &lt;- librarySizeFactors(sce.zeisel) summary(lib.sf.zeisel) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 0.172 0.544 0.864 1.000 1.290 4.247 In the Zeisel brain data, the library size factors differ by up to 10-fold across cells (Figure 9.1). This is typical of the variability in coverage in scRNA-seq data. hist(log10(lib.sf.zeisel), xlab=&quot;Log10[Size factor]&quot;, col=&#39;grey80&#39;) Figure 9.1: Distribution of size factors derived from the library size in the Zeisel brain dataset. Strictly speaking, the use of library size factors assumes that there is no “imbalance” in the differentially expressed (DE) genes between any pair of cells. That is, any upregulation for a subset of genes is cancelled out by the same magnitude of downregulation in a different subset of genes. This ensures that the library size is an unbiased estimate of the relative cell-specific bias5. (Otherwise, the estimate would be compromised by composition biases, as discussed in Robinson and Oshlack (2010).) This may not be true in scRNA-seq applications, which means that library size normalization may not yield accurate normalized expression values for downstream analyses. In practice, normalization accuracy is not a major consideration for exploratory scRNA-seq data analyses. Composition biases do not usually affect the separation of clusters, only the magnitude - and to a lesser extent, direction - of the log-fold changes between clusters or cell types. As such, library size normalization is usually sufficient in many applications where the aim is to identify clusters and the top markers that define each cluster. 9.4 Normalization by deconvolution As previously mentioned, composition biases will be present when any unbalanced differential expression exists between samples. Consider the simple example of two cells where a single gene \\(X\\) is upregulated in one cell \\(A\\) compared to the other cell \\(B\\). This upregulation means that either (i) more sequencing resources are devoted to \\(X\\) in \\(A\\), thus decreasing coverage of all other non-DE genes when the total library size of each cell is experimentally fixed (e.g., due to library quantification); or (ii) the library size of \\(A\\) increases when \\(X\\) is assigned more reads or UMIs, increasing the library size factor and yielding smaller normalized expression values for all non-DE genes. In both cases, the net effect is that non-DE genes in \\(A\\) will incorrectly appear to be downregulated compared to \\(B\\). The removal of composition biases is a well-studied problem for bulk RNA sequencing data analysis. Normalization can be performed with the estimateSizeFactorsFromMatrix() function in the DESeq2 package (Anders and Huber 2010; Love, Huber, and Anders 2014) or with the calcNormFactors() function (Robinson and Oshlack 2010) in the edgeR package. These assume that most genes are not DE between cells. Any systematic difference in count size across the non-DE majority of genes between two cells is assumed to represent bias that is used to compute an appropriate size factor for its removal. However, single-cell data can be problematic for these bulk normalization methods due to the dominance of low and zero counts. To overcome this, we pool counts from many cells to increase the size of the counts for accurate size factor estimation (Lun, Bach, and Marioni 2016). Pool-based size factors are then “deconvolved” into cell-based factors for normalization of each cell’s expression profile. This is performed using the computeSumFactors() function from scran, as shown below. library(scran) set.seed(100) clust.zeisel &lt;- quickCluster(sce.zeisel) table(clust.zeisel) ## clust.zeisel ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ## 425 256 368 379 159 189 155 304 283 196 291 deconv.sf.zeisel &lt;- computeSumFactors(sce.zeisel, cluster=clust.zeisel, sf.out=TRUE, min.mean=0.1) summary(deconv.sf.zeisel) ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 0.115 0.468 0.812 1.000 1.315 4.878 The above code contains several points worth elaborating on: We use a pre-clustering step with quickCluster() where cells in each cluster are normalized separately and the size factors are rescaled to be comparable across clusters. This avoids the assumption that most genes are non-DE across the entire population - only a non-DE majority is required between pairs of clusters, which is a weaker assumption for highly heterogeneous populations. By default, quickCluster() will use an approximate algorithm for PCA based on methods from the irlba package. The approximation relies on stochastic initialization so we need to set the random seed (via set.seed()) for reproducibility. sf.out=TRUE simply instructs the function to return the size factors directly, rather than a SingleCellExperiment containing the size factors. In the latter case, the size factors can be easily extracted with the sizeFactors() function. The deconvolution approach will eventually fail if too many counts are zero, manifesting as nonsensical negative size factors. To avoid this, computeSumFactors() will automatically remove low-abundance genes with average counts below min.mean. For read count data, the default value of 1 is usually satisfactory, but UMI counts are naturally lower so we set min.mean=0.1. We see that the deconvolution size factors exhibit cell type-specific deviations from the library size factors in Figure 9.2. This is consistent with the presence of composition biases that are introduced by strong differential expression between cell types. Use of the deconvolution size factors adjusts for these biases to improve normalization accuracy for downstream applications. plot(lib.sf.zeisel, deconv.sf.zeisel, xlab=&quot;Library size factor&quot;, ylab=&quot;Deconvolution size factor&quot;, log=&#39;xy&#39;, pch=16, col=as.integer(factor(sce.zeisel$level1class))) abline(a=0, b=1, col=&quot;red&quot;) Figure 9.2: Deconvolution size factor for each cell in the Zeisel brain dataset, compared to the equivalent size factor derived from the library size. The red line corresponds to identity between the two size factors. Accurate normalization is most important for procedures that involve estimation and interpretation of per-gene statistics. For example, composition biases can compromise DE analyses by systematically shifting the log-fold changes in one direction or another. However, it tends to provide less benefit over simple library size normalization for cell-based analyses such as clustering. The presence of composition biases already implies strong differences in expression profiles, so changing the normalization strategy is unlikely to affect the outcome of a clustering procedure. 9.5 Normalization by spike-ins Spike-in normalization is based on the assumption that the same amount of spike-in RNA was added to each cell (A. T. L. Lun et al. 2017). Systematic differences in the coverage of the spike-in transcripts can only be due to cell-specific biases, e.g., in capture efficiency or sequencing depth. To remove these biases, we equalize spike-in coverage across cells by scaling with “spike-in size factors”. Compared to the previous methods, spike-in normalization requires no assumption about the biology of the system (i.e., the absence of many DE genes). Isntead, it assumes that the spike-in transcripts were (i) added at a constant level to each cell, and (ii) respond to biases in the same relative manner as endogenous genes. Practically, spike-in normalization should be used if differences in the total RNA content of individual cells are of interest and must be preserved in downstream analyses. For a given cell, an increase in its overall amount of endogenous RNA will not increase its spike-in size factor. This ensures that the effects of total RNA content on expression across the population will not be removed upon scaling. By comparison, the other normalization methods described above will simply interpret any change in total RNA content as part of the bias and remove it. We demonstrate the use of spike-in normalization on a different dataset involving mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Islam et al. 2011). library(BiocFileCache) bfc &lt;- BiocFileCache(&quot;raw_data&quot;, ask=FALSE) islam.fname &lt;- bfcrpath(bfc, file.path(&quot;ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series&quot;, &quot;GSE29nnn/GSE29087/suppl/GSE29087_L139_expression_tab.txt.gz&quot;)) counts &lt;- read.table(islam.fname, colClasses=c(list(&quot;character&quot;, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL), rep(&quot;integer&quot;, 96)), skip=6, sep=&#39;\\t&#39;, row.names=1) is.spike &lt;- grep(&quot;SPIKE&quot;, rownames(counts)) sce.islam &lt;- SingleCellExperiment(list(counts=as.matrix(counts))) isSpike(sce.islam, &quot;spike&quot;) &lt;- is.spike sce.islam$grouping &lt;- rep(c(&quot;mESC&quot;, &quot;MEF&quot;, &quot;Neg&quot;), c(48, 44, 4)) sce.islam ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 22936 96 ## metadata(0): ## assays(1): counts ## rownames(22936): RNA_SPIKE_1 RNA_SPIKE_2 ... r_U14 r_(CGTAG)n ## rowData names(0): ## colnames(96): V8 V9 ...

This method computes the total count over all spike-in transcripts in each cell, and calculates size factors to equalize the total spike-in count across cells. It assumes that the relevant rows of the SingleCellExperiment have been marked as spike-ins with the isSpike()&lt;- function. Again, we set sf.out=TRUE to return the spike-in size factors directly for simplicity. spike.sf.islam &lt;- computeSpikeFactors(sce.islam, sf.out=TRUE) We observe a negative correlation between the two sets of size factors (Figure 9.3). This is because MEFs contain more endogenous RNA, which reduces the relative spike-in coverage in each library (thereby decreasing the spike-in size factors) but increases the coverage of endogenous genes (thus increasing the library size factors). If the spike-in size factors were applied to the counts, the expression values in MEFs would be scaled up while expression in mESCs would be scaled down. However, the opposite would occur if library size factors were used. lib.sf.islam &lt;- librarySizeFactors(sce.islam) colours &lt;- c(mESC=&quot;red&quot;, MEF=&quot;grey&quot;) plot(lib.sf.islam, spike.sf.islam, col=colours[sce.islam$grouping], pch=16, log=&quot;xy&quot;, xlab=&quot;Library size factor&quot;, ylab=&quot;Spike-in size factor&quot;) legend(&quot;bottomleft&quot;, col=colours, legend=names(colours), pch=16) Figure 9.3: Size factors from spike-in normalization, plotted against the library size factors for all cells in the mESC/MEF dataset. Each point is a cells, coloured according to its type. Whether or not total RNA content is relevant – and thus, the choice of normalization strategy – depends on the biological hypothesis. In most cases, changes in total RNA content are not interesting and can be normalized out by applying the library size or deconvolution factors. However, this may not always be appropriate if differences in total RNA are associated with a biological process of interest, e.g., cell cycle activity or T cell activation (Richard et al. 2018). Spike-in normalization will preserve these differences such that any changes in expression between biological groups have the correct sign. However! Regardless of whether we care about total RNA content, it is critical that the spike-in transcripts are normalized using the spike-in size factors. Size factors computed from the counts for endogenous genes should not be applied to the spike-in transcripts, precisely because the former captures differences in total RNA content that are not experienced by the latter. Attempting to normalize the spike-in counts with the gene-based size factors will lead to over-normalization and incorrect quantification. Thus, whenever spike-in data is present, we must compute a separate set of size factors for the spike-in set. This is discussed below for the Zeisel dataset. 9.6 Putting it all together We calculate all necessary size factors as shown below. Each of the compute*Factors() functions now returns a SingleCellExperiment containing the computed size factors. We set general.use=FALSE in computeSpikeFactors() to indicate that the spike-in size factors are only to be used for the spike-in transcripts and not for all genes in sce.zeisel. # TODO: no need for a separate computeSpikeFactors() call when # we switch over to altExp(). set.seed(100) clust.zeisel &lt;- quickCluster(sce.zeisel) sce.zeisel &lt;- computeSumFactors(sce.zeisel, cluster=clust.zeisel, min.mean=0.1) sce.zeisel &lt;- computeSpikeFactors(sce.zeisel, &#39;ERCC&#39;, general.use=FALSE) Inspection of the SingleCellExperiment indicates that, indeed, two different sets of spike-ins have been added. summary(sizeFactors(sce.zeisel)) ## Min. 1st Qu.

This is done by dividing the count for each gene/spike-in transcript with the appropriate size factor for that cell. The function also log-transforms the normalized values, creating a new assay called &quot;logcounts&quot;6. These log-values will be the basis of our downstream analyses in the following chapters. sce.zeisel &lt;- normalize(sce.zeisel) assayNames(sce.zeisel) ## [1] &quot;counts&quot; &quot;logcounts&quot; 9.7 Why (log-)transform? The log-transformation is useful as differences in the log-values represent log-fold changes in expression. This is important in downstream procedures based on Euclidean distances, which includes many forms of clustering and dimensionality reduction. By operating on log-transformed data, we ensure that these procedures are measuring distances between cells based on log-fold changes in expression. Or in other words, which is more interesting - a gene that is expressed at an average count of 50 in cell type \\(A\\) and 10 in cell type \\(B\\), or a gene that is expressed at an average count of 1100 in \\(A\\) and 1000 in \\(B\\)? Log-transformation focuses on the former by promoting contributions from genes with strong relative differences. When log-transforming, we need to consider the pseudo-count that is added to avoid undefined values at zero. Larger pseudo-counts will effectively shrink the log-fold changes between cells towards zero for low-abundance genes, meaning that downstream analyses will be driven more by differences in expression for high-abundance genes. Conversely, smaller pseudo-counts will increase the contribution of low-abundance genes. Common practice is to use a pseudo-count of 1, for the simple pragmatic reason7 that it preserves sparsity in the original matrix (i.e., zeroes in the input remain zeroes after transformation). This works well in all but the most pathological scenarios (???). (Incidentally, the addition of the pseudo-count is the motivation for the centering of the size factors at unity. This ensures that both the pseudo-count and the normalized expression values are on the same scale. A pseudo-count of 1 can then be interpreted as an extra read or UMI for each gene. In practical terms, this means that the shrinkage effect of the pseudo-count diminishes as sequencing depth improves. This is the correct behavior as it allows log-fold change estimates to become increasingly accurate with deeper coverage. In contrast, if we had simply divided each cell’s counts by its library size before log-transformation, accuracy of the log-fold changes would never improve regardless of how much additional sequencing we performed.) Of course, log-transformation is not the only possible transformation. More sophisticated approaches can be used such as dedicated variance stabilizing transformations (e.g., from the DESeq2 or sctransform packages), which out-perform the log-transformation for removal of the mean-variance trend. In practice, though, the log-transformation is a good default choice due its simplicity (a.k.a., reliability8, predictability and computational efficiency) and interpretability.

Procedures like clustering and dimensionality reduction compare cells based on their gene expression profiles, which involves aggregating per-gene differences into a single (dis)similarity metric between a pair of cells. The choice of genes to use in this calculation has a major impact on the behavior of the metric and the performance of downstream methods. We want to select genes that contain useful information about the biology of the system while removing genes that contain random noise. This aims to preserve interesting biological structure without the variance that obscures that structure. It also reduces the size of the dataset to improve computational efficiency of later steps. The simplest approach to feature selection is to select the most variable genes based on their expression across the population. This assumes that genuine biological differences will manifest as increased variation in the affected genes, compared to other genes that are only affected by technical noise or a baseline level of “uninteresting” biological variation (e.g., from transcriptional bursting). Several methods are available to quantify the variation per gene and to select the highly variable genes (HVGs), which we will discuss below. For demonstration, we will use the 10X PBMC dataset: View history ### loading ### library(BiocFileCache) bfc &lt;- BiocFileCache(&quot;raw_data&quot;, ask = FALSE) raw.path &lt;- bfcrpath(bfc, file.path(&quot;http://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples&quot;, &quot;cell-exp/2.1.0/pbmc4k/pbmc4k_raw_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz&quot;)) untar(raw.path, exdir=file.path(tempdir(), &quot;pbmc4k&quot;)) library(DropletUtils) fname &lt;- file.path(tempdir(), &quot;pbmc4k/raw_gene_bc_matrices/GRCh38&quot;) sce.pbmc &lt;- read10xCounts(fname, col.names=TRUE) ### gene-annotation ### library(scater) rownames(sce.pbmc) &lt;- uniquifyFeatureNames(rowData(sce.pbmc)$ID, rowData(sce.pbmc)$Symbol) library(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86) location &lt;- mapIds(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86, keys=rowData(sce.pbmc)$ID, column=&quot;SEQNAME&quot;, keytype=&quot;GENEID&quot;) ### cell-detection ### set.seed(100) e.out &lt;- emptyDrops(counts(sce.pbmc)) sce.pbmc &lt;- sce.pbmc[,which(e.out$FDR &lt;= 0.001)] ### quality-control ### sce.pbmc &lt;- calculateQCMetrics(sce.pbmc, feature_controls=list(Mito=which(location==&quot;MT&quot;))) high.mito &lt;- isOutlier(sce.pbmc$pct_counts_Mito, nmads=3, type=&quot;higher&quot;) sce.pbmc &lt;- sce.pbmc[,!high.mito] ### normalization ### library(scran) set.seed(1000) clusters &lt;- quickCluster(sce.pbmc) sce.pbmc &lt;- computeSumFactors(sce.pbmc, min.mean=0.1, cluster=clusters) sce.pbmc &lt;- normalize(sce.pbmc) sce.pbmc ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 33694 3922 ## metadata(1): log.exprs.offset ## assays(2): counts logcounts ## rownames(33694): RP11-34P13.3 FAM138A ...

This has an advantage in that the feature selection is based on the same log-values that are used for later downstream steps. Genes with the largest variances in log-values will contribute the most to the Euclidean distances between cells. By using log-values here, we ensure that our quantitative definition of heterogeneity is consistent throughout the entire analysis. Calculation of the per-gene variance is simple but feature selection requires modelling of the mean-variance relationship. As discussed briefly in the last chapter, the log-transformation does not achieve perfect variance stabilization. This means that the variance of a gene is more affected by its abundance than the underlying biological heterogeneity. To account for this effect, we use the modelGeneVar() function to fit a trend to the variance with respect to abundance across all genes (Figure 10.1). library(scran) dec.pbmc &lt;- modelGeneVar(sce.pbmc) # Visualizing the fit: fit.pbmc &lt;- metadata(dec.pbmc) plot(fit.pbmc$mean, fit.pbmc$var, xlab=&quot;Mean of log-expression&quot;, ylab=&quot;Variance of log-expression&quot;) curve(fit.pbmc$trend(x), col=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;, add=TRUE, lwd=2) Figure 10.1: Variance in the PBMC data set as a function of the mean. Each point represents a gene while the blue line represents the trend fitted to all genes. At any given abundance, we assume that the expression profiles of most genes are dominated by random technical noise (see 10.2.3 for details). Under this assumption, our trend represents an estimate of the technical noise as a function of abundance. We then break down the total variance of each gene into the technical component, i.e., the fitted value of the trend at that gene’s abundance; and the biological component, defined as the difference between the total variance and the technical component. This biological component represents the “interesting” variation for each gene and can be used as the metric for HVG selection. # Ordering by most interesting genes for inspection. dec.pbmc[order(dec.pbmc$bio, decreasing=TRUE),] ## DataFrame with 33694 rows and 6 columns ## mean total tech ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## LYZ 1.97720774557909 5.1093189779025 0.829103126835094 ## S100A9 1.94951728004377 4.58067979752236 0.829355453195275 ## S100A8 1.71813080049068 4.450555343632 0.82113988580669 ## HLA-DRA 2.09809035649377 3.73632552542342 0.825379686156474 ## CD74 2.89964299605066 3.32217806233448 0.794847543782114 ## ... ... ... ... ## PTMA 3.8310477802539 0.473973817102772 0.742787431378562 ## HLA-B 4.50257580785005 0.477758219250801 0.758429136842052 ## EIF1 3.24339798459787 0.477492332280039 0.773251499236556 ## TMSB4X 6.08574497419255 0.405491648922873 0.748371857455256 ## B2M 5.95574224289044 0.303964766423101 0.720380629718446 ## bio p.value FDR ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## LYZ 4.2802158510674 1.21228447173797e-263 1.19106949348255e-259 ## S100A9 3.75132434432709 5.94502641052638e-203 3.89399229889478e-199 ## S100A8 3.62941545782531 6.64639337130205e-194 3.26504074365213e-190 ## HLA-DRA 2.91094583926695 2.66248562787844e-124 4.02444942983164e-121 ## CD74 2.52733051855236 1.85527889318145e-101 1.73601096433407e-98 ## ... ... ... ... ## PTMA -0.26881361427579 0.992456099633289 0.999999999334437 ## HLA-B -0.280670917591251 0.993524809206667 0.999999999334437 ## EIF1 -0.295759166956516 0.994893426785729 0.999999999334437 ## TMSB4X -0.342880208532382 0.998953636877237 0.999999999334437 ## B2M -0.416415863295345 0.999948154914924 0.999999999334437 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 1.97720774557909 ## 1.94951728004377 ## 1.71813080049068 ## 2.09809035649377 ## 2.89964299605066 ## ... ## 3.8310477802539 ## 4.50257580785005 ## 3.24339798459787 ## 6.08574497419255 ## 5.95574224289044 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 5.1093189779025 ## 4.58067979752236 ## 4.450555343632 ## 3.73632552542342 ## 3.32217806233448 ## ... ## 0.473973817102772 ## 0.477758219250801 ## 0.477492332280039 ## 0.405491648922873 ## 0.303964766423101 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0.829103126835094 ## 0.829355453195275 ## 0.82113988580669 ## 0.825379686156474 ## 0.794847543782114 ## ... ## 0.742787431378562 ## 0.758429136842052 ## 0.773251499236556 ## 0.748371857455256 ## 0.720380629718446 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 4.2802158510674 ## 3.75132434432709 ## 3.62941545782531 ## 2.91094583926695 ## 2.52733051855236 ## ... ## -0.26881361427579 ## -0.280670917591251 ## -0.295759166956516 ## -0.342880208532382 ## -0.416415863295345 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 1.21228447173797e-263 ## 5.94502641052638e-203 ## 6.64639337130205e-194 ## 2.66248562787844e-124 ## 1.85527889318145e-101 ## ... ## 0.992456099633289 ## 0.993524809206667 ## 0.994893426785729 ## 0.998953636877237 ## 0.999948154914924 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 1.19106949348255e-259 ## 3.89399229889478e-199 ## 3.26504074365213e-190 ## 4.02444942983164e-121 ## 1.73601096433407e-98 ## ... ## 0.999999999334437 ## 0.999999999334437 ## 0.999999999334437 ## 0.999999999334437 ## 0.999999999334437 (Careful readers will notice that some genes have negative biological components. Negative components of variation have no obvious interpretation and can be ignored for most applications. They are inevitable when fitting a trend to the per-gene variances, as approximately half of the genes will lie below the trend.) 10.2.2 Coefficient of variation An alternative approach to quantification uses the squared coefficient of variation (CV2) of the normalized expression values prior to log-transformation. The CV2 is a widely used metric for describing variation in non-negative data and is closely related to the dispersion parameter of the negative binomial distribution in packages like edgeR and DESeq2. We compute the CV2 for each gene in the PBMC dataset using the modelGeneCV2() function, which provides a robust implementation of the approach described by Brennecke et al. (2013). dec.cv2.pbmc &lt;- modelGeneCV2(sce.pbmc) This allows us to model the mean-variance relationship when considering the relevance of each gene (Figure 10.2). Again, our assumption is that most genes contain random noise and that the trend captures mostly technical variation. Large CV\\(^2\\) values that deviate strongly from the trend are likely to represent genes affected by biological structure. fit.cv2.pbmc &lt;- metadata(dec.cv2.pbmc) plot(fit.cv2.pbmc$mean, fit.cv2.pbmc$cv2, log=&quot;xy&quot;) curve(fit.cv2.pbmc$trend(x), col=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;, add=TRUE, lwd=2) Figure 10.2: CV2 in the PBMC data set as a function of the mean. Each point represents a gene while the blue line represents the fitted trend. For each gene, we quantify the deviation from the trend in terms of the ratio of its CV2 to the fitted value of trend at its abundance. This is more appropriate than the directly subtracting the trend from the CV2, as the magnitude of the ratio is not affected by the mean. dec.cv2.pbmc[order(dec.cv2.pbmc$ratio, decreasing=TRUE),] ## DataFrame with 33694 rows and 5 columns ## mean total trend ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## HIST1H2AC 0.903832087554474 267.52946465042 1.56249347165887 ## GNG11 0.689915788093492 219.246474356754 1.98426985636371 ## PRTFDC1 0.0411712190890851 3039.89950832654 30.0648545637562 ## TNNC2 0.102005431273823 1211.47780026804 12.2552987937789 ## PF4 1.10708448892009 128.81923174922 1.31275273661753 ## ... ... ... ... ## AC023491.2 0 NaN Inf ## AC233755.2 0 NaN Inf ## AC233755.1 0 NaN Inf ## AC213203.1 0 NaN Inf ## FAM231B 0 NaN Inf ## ratio p.value ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## HIST1H2AC 171.219572755328 0 ## GNG11 110.492266792046 0 ## PRTFDC1 101.111399088263 0 ## TNNC2 98.8533874737529 0 ## PF4 98.129090236093 0 ## ... ... ... ## AC023491.2 NaN NaN ## AC233755.2 NaN NaN ## AC233755.1 NaN NaN ## AC213203.1 NaN NaN ## FAM231B NaN NaN ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0.903832087554474 ## 0.689915788093492 ## 0.0411712190890851 ## 0.102005431273823 ## 1.10708448892009 ## ... ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 267.52946465042 ## 219.246474356754 ## 3039.89950832654 ## 1211.47780026804 ## 128.81923174922 ## ... ## NaN ## NaN ## NaN ## NaN ## NaN ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 1.56249347165887 ## 1.98426985636371 ## 30.0648545637562 ## 12.2552987937789 ## 1.31275273661753 ## ... ## Inf ## Inf ## Inf ## Inf ## Inf ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 171.219572755328 ## 110.492266792046 ## 101.111399088263 ## 98.8533874737529 ## 98.129090236093 ## ... ## NaN ## NaN ## NaN ## NaN ## NaN ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## ... ## NaN ## NaN ## NaN ## NaN ## NaN Both the CV2 and the variance of log-counts are effective metrics for quantifying variation in gene expression. The CV2 tends to give higher rank to low-abundance HVGs driven by upregulation in rare subpopulations, for which the increase in variance on the raw scale is stronger than that on the log-scale. However, the variation described by the CV2 is less directly relevant to downstream procedures operating on the log-counts, and the reliance on the ratio can assign high rank to uninteresting genes with low absolute variance. We generally prefer the use of the variance of log-counts and will use it in the following sections, though the many of the same principles apply to procedures based on the CV2. 10.2.3 Quantifying technical noise The use of a trend fitted to endogenous genes assumes that the expression profiles of most genes are dominated by random technical noise. In practice, all expressed genes will exhibit some non-zero level of biological variability due to events like transcriptional bursting. This suggests that our estimates of the technical component are likely to be inflated. It would be more appropriate to consider these estimates as technical noise plus “uninteresting” biological variation, under the assumption that most genes are unaffected by the relevant heterogeneity in the population. This assumption is generally reasonable but may be problematic in some scenarios where many genes at a particular abundance are affected by a biological process. For example, strong upregulation of cell type-specific genes may result in an enrichment of HVGs at high abundances. This would inflate the fitted trend at high abundances and compromise the detection of the affected genes. We can avoid this problem by fitting a mean-dependent trend to the variance of the spike-in transcripts, if they are available (Figure 10.3). The premise here is that spike-ins should not be affected by biological variation, so the fitted value of the spike-in trend should represent a better estimate of the technical component for each gene. dec.spike.416b &lt;- modelGeneVarWithSpikes(sce.416b, &quot;ERCC&quot;) dec.spike.416b[order(dec.spike.416b$bio, decreasing=TRUE),] ## DataFrame with 46604 rows and 6 columns ## mean total tech ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## Lyz2 6.58452322626962 13.981115391828 1.57439813967028 ## Ccl9 6.71231727838975 13.2123141538704 1.44517363924406 ## Top2a 5.78674433920395 14.061964981076 2.55485592247822 ## Cd200r3 4.87041205832691 15.5629113090432 4.12756395747085 ## Ccnb2 5.90621334470428 13.3668217298191 2.37519789726572 ## ... ... ... ... ## Gm8623 2.99687811926373 0.906393458047858 6.58595054641976 ## Rpl5-ps2 3.60016942615025 0.611220853516254 6.32496226060295 ## Gm26825 3.22224019884412 0.865862049948253 6.58121590339427 ## Gm12816 2.91225548992418 0.8379080485496 6.56932341240521 ## Rps12l1 3.14861797000057 0.741526126629146 6.59206832695328 ## bio p.value FDR ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## Lyz2 12.4067172521577 2.67876851201925e-198 2.65689190250442e-195 ## Ccl9 11.7671405146263 1.51573651575589e-211 1.71812342957396e-208 ## Top2a 11.5071090585978 2.73161223403655e-66 7.22481084655623e-64 ## Cd200r3 11.4353473515723 2.42835264947996e-26 1.64685203613165e-24 ## Ccnb2 10.9916238325534 7.35199139996513e-70 2.16057781833049e-67 ## ... ... ... ... ## Gm8623 -5.6795570883719 0.999490513869684 0.999795028709123 ## Rpl5-ps2 -5.7137414070867 0.999710626616979 0.999795028709123 ## Gm26825 -5.71535385344601 0.999530711943699 0.999795028709123 ## Gm12816 -5.73141536385561 0.999555718435578 0.999795028709123 ## Rps12l1 -5.85054220032413 0.999638884480882 0.999795028709123 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 6.58452322626962 ## 6.71231727838975 ## 5.78674433920395 ## 4.87041205832691 ## 5.90621334470428 ## ... ## 2.99687811926373 ## 3.60016942615025 ## 3.22224019884412 ## 2.91225548992418 ## 3.14861797000057 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 13.981115391828 ## 13.2123141538704 ## 14.061964981076 ## 15.5629113090432 ## 13.3668217298191 ## ... ## 0.906393458047858 ## 0.611220853516254 ## 0.865862049948253 ## 0.8379080485496 ## 0.741526126629146 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 1.57439813967028 ## 1.44517363924406 ## 2.55485592247822 ## 4.12756395747085 ## 2.37519789726572 ## ... ## 6.58595054641976 ## 6.32496226060295 ## 6.58121590339427 ## 6.56932341240521 ## 6.59206832695328 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 12.4067172521577 ## 11.7671405146263 ## 11.5071090585978 ## 11.4353473515723 ## 10.9916238325534 ## ... ## -5.6795570883719 ## -5.7137414070867 ## -5.71535385344601 ## -5.73141536385561 ## -5.85054220032413 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 2.67876851201925e-198 ## 1.51573651575589e-211 ## 2.73161223403655e-66 ## 2.42835264947996e-26 ## 7.35199139996513e-70 ## ... ## 0.999490513869684 ## 0.999710626616979 ## 0.999530711943699 ## 0.999555718435578 ## 0.999638884480882 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 2.65689190250442e-195 ## 1.71812342957396e-208 ## 7.22481084655623e-64 ## 1.64685203613165e-24 ## 2.16057781833049e-67 ## ... ## 0.999795028709123 ## 0.999795028709123 ## 0.999795028709123 ## 0.999795028709123 ## 0.999795028709123 plot(dec.spike.416b$mean, dec.spike.416b$total, xlab=&quot;Mean of log-expression&quot;, ylab=&quot;Variance of log-expression&quot;) fit.spike.416b &lt;- metadata(dec.spike.416b) points(fit.spike.416b$mean, fit.spike.416b$var, col=&quot;red&quot;, pch=16) curve(fit.spike.416b$trend(x), col=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;, add=TRUE, lwd=2) Figure 10.3: Variance in the 416B data set as a function of the mean. Each point represents a gene (black) or spike-in transcript (red) and the blue line represents the trend fitted to all spike-ins. In the absence of spike-in data, one can attempt to create a trend by making some distributional assumptions about the noise. For example, UMI counts typically exhibit near-Poisson noise when only technical effects are considered. This can be used to construct a mean-variance trend in the log-counts (Figure 10.4) with the modelGeneVarByPoisson() function. Note the increased residuals of the high-abundance genes, which can be interpreted as the amount of biological variation that was assumed to be “uninteresting” when fitting the gene-based trend in Figure 10.1. set.seed(0010101) dec.pois.pbmc &lt;- modelGeneVarByPoisson(sce.pbmc) dec.pois.pbmc &lt;- dec.pois.pbmc[order(dec.pois.pbmc$bio, decreasing=TRUE),] head(dec.pois.pbmc) ## DataFrame with 6 rows and 6 columns ## mean total tech ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## LYZ 1.97720774557909 5.1093189779025 0.625920315505478 ## S100A9 1.94951728004377 4.58067979752236 0.631472547597445 ## S100A8 1.71813080049068 4.450555343632 0.672535358554497 ## HLA-DRA 2.09809035649377 3.73632552542342 0.600680256885254 ## CD74 2.89964299605066 3.32217806233448 0.425592152350886 ## CST3 1.4921009978511 2.96883317240039 0.697923385529405 ## bio p.value FDR ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## LYZ 4.48339866239702 0 0 ## S100A9 3.94920724992492 0 0 ## S100A8 3.77801998507751 0 0 ## HLA-DRA 3.13564526853816 0 0 ## CD74 2.89658590998359 0 0 ## CST3 2.27090978687099 0 0 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 1.97720774557909 ## 1.94951728004377 ## 1.71813080049068 ## 2.09809035649377 ## 2.89964299605066 ## 1.4921009978511 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 5.1093189779025 ## 4.58067979752236 ## 4.450555343632 ## 3.73632552542342 ## 3.32217806233448 ## 2.96883317240039 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0.625920315505478 ## 0.631472547597445 ## 0.672535358554497 ## 0.600680256885254 ## 0.425592152350886 ## 0.697923385529405 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 4.48339866239702 ## 3.94920724992492 ## 3.77801998507751 ## 3.13564526853816 ## 2.89658590998359 ## 2.27090978687099 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 plot(dec.pois.pbmc$mean, dec.pois.pbmc$total, pch=16, xlab=&quot;Mean of log-expression&quot;, ylab=&quot;Variance of log-expression&quot;) curve(metadata(dec.pois.pbmc)$trend(x), col=&quot;dodgerblue&quot;, add=TRUE) Figure 10.4: Variance of normalized log-expression values for each gene in the PBMC dataset, plotted against the mean log-expression.

We are (usually) not interested in HVGs that are driven by batch effects. Rather, we want to focus on genes that are highly variable within each batch. This is naturally achieved by performing trend fitting and variance decomposition separately for each batch. We demonstrate this approach by treating each plate (block) in the 416B dataset as a different batch, using the modelGeneVarWithSpikes() function. (The same argument is available in all other variance-modelling functions.) dec.block.416b &lt;- modelGeneVarWithSpikes(sce.416b, &quot;ERCC&quot;, block=sce.416b$block) head(dec.block.416b[order(dec.block.416b$bio, decreasing=TRUE),1:6]) ## DataFrame with 6 rows and 6 columns ## mean total tech ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## Lyz2 6.5888839665632 13.9879587012246 1.59005301830697 ## Ccl9 6.71152694096627 13.2838732503136 1.38839690248626 ## Cd200r3 4.87339059420103 15.6086389540576 4.18071722807439 ## Top2a 5.79434982405204 13.8554180869451 2.7386542626093 ## Ccnb2 5.91377600206442 13.1732321163212 2.5544833544482 ## Hbb-bt 4.90872275033472 14.7067184567165 4.09107979580209 ## bio p.value FDR ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## Lyz2 12.3979056829176 0 0 ## Ccl9 11.8954763478274 0 0 ## Cd200r3 11.4279217259832 1.26914883229919e-55 8.09941522896778e-54 ## Top2a 11.1167638243358 1.7661124143504e-127 3.65569912271278e-125 ## Ccnb2 10.618748761873 4.39888780633588e-140 1.05768813476787e-137 ## Hbb-bt 10.6156386609144 1.00779070037796e-47 5.35478790888324e-46 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 6.5888839665632 ## 6.71152694096627 ## 4.87339059420103 ## 5.79434982405204 ## 5.91377600206442 ## 4.90872275033472 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 13.9879587012246 ## 13.2838732503136 ## 15.6086389540576 ## 13.8554180869451 ## 13.1732321163212 ## 14.7067184567165 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 1.59005301830697 ## 1.38839690248626 ## 4.18071722807439 ## 2.7386542626093 ## 2.5544833544482 ## 4.09107979580209 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 12.3979056829176 ## 11.8954763478274 ## 11.4279217259832 ## 11.1167638243358 ## 10.618748761873 ## 10.6156386609144 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0 ## 0 ## 1.26914883229919e-55 ## 1.7661124143504e-127 ## 4.39888780633588e-140 ## 1.00779070037796e-47 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0 ## 0 ## 8.09941522896778e-54 ## 3.65569912271278e-125 ## 1.05768813476787e-137 ## 5.35478790888324e-46 The use of a batch-specific trend fit is useful as it accommodates differences in the mean-variance trends between batches. This is especially important if batches exhibit systematic technical differences, e.g., differences in coverage or in the amount of spike-in RNA added. In this case, there are only minor differences between the trends in Figure 10.5, which indicates that the experiment was tightly replicated across plates. The analysis of each plate yields estimates of the biological and technical components for each gene, which are averaged across plates to take advantage of information from multiple batches. par(mfrow=c(1,2)) blocked.stats &lt;- dec.block.416b$per.block for (i in colnames(blocked.stats)) { current &lt;- blocked.stats[[i]] plot(current$mean, current$total, main=i, pch=16, cex=0.5, xlab=&quot;Mean of log-expression&quot;, ylab=&quot;Variance of log-expression&quot;) curfit &lt;- metadata(current) points(curfit$mean, curfit$var, col=&quot;red&quot;, pch=16) curve(curfit$trend(x), col=&#39;dodgerblue&#39;, add=TRUE, lwd=2) } Figure 10.5: Variance in the 416B data set as a function of the mean after blocking on the plate of origin. Each plot represents the results for a single plate, each point represents a gene (black) or spike-in transcript (red) and the blue line represents the trend fitted to all spike-ins. 10.2.4.2 Using a design matrix The use of block-specific trends is the recommended approach for experiments with a single blocking factor. However, this is not practical for studies involving a large number of blocking factors and/or covariates.

Briefly, the technical component is estimated as the fitted value of the trend at the average abundance for each gene. However, the true technical component is the average of the fitted values at the per-block means, which may be quite different for strong batch effects and non-linear mean-variance relationships. The block= approach is safer and should be preferred in all situations where it is applicable. 10.3 Selecting highly variable genes 10.3.1 Based on the largest metrics Once we have quantified the per-gene variation, the next step is to select the subset of HVGs to use in downstream analyses. The simplest approach is to simply take the top \\(X\\) genes with the largest values for the relevant measure of variation. For modelGeneVar() and modelGeneVarWithSpikes(), this would be the genes with the largest biological components: hvg.pbmc.var &lt;- head(order(dec.pbmc$bio, decreasing=TRUE), 1000) hvg.pbmc.var &lt;- rownames(dec.pbmc)[hvg.pbmc.var] For modelGeneCV2() (and its relative, modelGeneCV2WithSpikes()), this would instead be the genes with the largest ratios: hvg.pbmc.cv2 &lt;- head(order(dec.cv2.pbmc$ratio, decreasing=TRUE), 1000) hvg.pbmc.cv2 &lt;- rownames(dec.pbmc)[hvg.pbmc.cv2] The main advantage of this approach is that the user can easily control the number of genes retained. This ensures that the computational complexity of downstream calculations is easily predicted. It is also fairly easy to translate the choice of \\(X\\) into a biological statement. Recall our trend-fitting assumption that most genes are not differentially expressed between cell types or states in our population. If we quantify this assumption into a statement that, e.g., no more than 5% of genes are differentially expressed, we can simply take the top 5% of genes with the largest variance. The main disadvantage of this approach that it turns HVG selection into a competition between genes, whereby a subset of very highly variable genes can push other informative genes out of the top set. This can be problematic if a single subpopulation is very different from the others. In such cases, the top set will be dominated by differentially expressed genes involving the outlier subpopulation, compromising resolution of heterogeneity between the other populations. Similar problems are encountered when the magnitude of the chosen variance measure varies with abundance. The choice of \\(X\\) is also fairly arbitrary, with any value from 500 to 5000 being considered “reasonable”. We have chosen \\(X=1000\\) in the code above though there is no particular a priori reason for doing so. A larger \\(X\\) will reduce the risk of discarding signal at the cost of increasing noise that obscures signal. Our recommendation is to simply pick an arbitrary \\(X\\) and proceed with the rest of the analysis, with the intention of testing other choices later, rather than spending much time worrying about obtaining the “optimal” value9. 10.3.2 Based on a fixed threshold Another approach to feature selection is to set a fixed threshold of one of the metrics. This is most commonly done with the (adjusted) \\(p\\)-value reported by each of the above methods. The \\(p\\)-value for each gene is generated by testing against the null hypothesis that the variance is equal to the trend. For example, we might define our HVGs as all genes that have adjusted \\(p\\)-values below 0.05. # &#39;which()&#39; automatically removes &#39;NA&#39; FDR values. hvg.pbmc.var.2 &lt;- rownames(dec.pbmc)[which(dec.pbmc$FDR &lt;= 0.05)] length(hvg.pbmc.var.2) ## [1] 642 This approach is simple to implement and - if the test holds its size - it controls the false discovery rate (FDR). That is, it returns a subset of genes where the proportion of false positives is expected to be below the specified threshold. This can occasionally be useful in applications where the HVGs themselves are of interest. For example, if a collaborator were to take a list of HVGs back to the bench to verify the existence of heterogeneous expression for some of the genes, we would want to control the FDR in that list. The downside of this approach is that it is less predictable than the top \\(X\\) strategy. The number of genes returned depends on the type II error rate of the test and the severity of the multiple testing correction. One might obtain no genes or every gene at a given FDR threshold, depending on the circumstances. Moreover, control of the FDR is usually not helpful at this stage of the analysis. We are not interpreting the individual HVGs themselves but are only using them for feature selection prior to downstream steps. There is no reason to think that a 5% threshold on the FDR yields a more suitable compromise between bias and noise. 10.3.3 Keeping all genes above the trend As the title suggests, this involves keeping all genes above the trend. The rationale is to only remove the obviously uninteresting genes with variances below the trend. By doing so, we avoid the need to make any judgement calls regarding what level of variation is interesting enough to retain. This approach represents one extreme of the bias-variance trade-off where bias is minimized at the cost of maximizing noise. For decomposeVar(), it equates to keeping all positive biological components: hvg.pbmc.var.3 &lt;- rownames(dec.pbmc)[dec.pbmc$bio &gt; 0] length(hvg.pbmc.var.3) ## [1] 12776 For improvedCV2(), this involves keeping all ratios above 1: # &#39;which()&#39; automatically removes &#39;NA&#39; ratios. hvg.pbmc.cv2.3 &lt;- rownames(dec.cv2.pbmc)[which(dec.cv2.pbmc$ratio &gt; 1)] length(hvg.pbmc.cv2.3) ## [1] 9390 This strategy is the most conservative as it does not discard any potential biological signal. Weak or secondary population structure is given the chance to manifest as the affected genes are retained. This makes it useful for reliable automated processing of diverse data sets where the primary factor of variation in one data set is a secondary factor in another data set (and thus overlooked by the top \\(X\\) approach). The obvious cost is that more noise is also captured, which can reduce the resolution of otherwise well-separated populations. From a practical perspective, the use of more genes involves more computational work in each downstream step. 10.4 Putting it all together The few lines of code below will select the top 10% of genes with the highest biological components. dec.pbmc &lt;- modelGeneVar(sce.pbmc) chosen &lt;- rownames(dec.pbmc)[order(dec.pbmc$bio, decreasing=TRUE)] chosen &lt;- head(chosen, nrow(dec.pbmc) * 0.1) length(chosen) ## [1] 3369 We can then subset the SingleCellExperiment to only retain our selection of HVGs. This ensures that downstream methods will only use these genes for their calculations. sce.pbmc &lt;- sce.pbmc[chosen,] dim(sce.pbmc) ## [1] 3369 3922 Alternatively, some methods may allow users to pass in the full SingleCellExperiment object and specify the genes to use via an extra argument like subset.row=. This may be more convenient in the context of the overall analysis, where genes outside of this subset may still be of interest during DE analyses or for visualization.

For example, clustering aims to identify cells with similar transcriptomic profiles by computing Euclidean distances across genes. In these applications, each individual gene represents a dimension of the data. More intuitively, if we had a scRNA-seq data set with two genes, we could make a two-dimensional plot where each axis represents the expression of one gene and each point in the plot represents a cell. This concept can be extended to data sets with thousands of genes where each cell’s expression profile defines its location in the high-dimensional expression space. Dimensionality reduction aims to reduce the number of separate dimensions10 in the data. This is possible because different genes are correlated if they are affected by the same biological process. Thus, we do not need to store separate information for individual genes, but can instead compress multiple features into a single dimension, e.g., an “eigengene” (???). This reduces computational work in downstream analyses, as calculations only need to be performed for a few dimensions rather than thousands of genes; reduces noise by averaging across multiple genes to obtain a more precise representation of the patterns in the data; and enables effective plotting of the data, for those of us who are not capable of visualizing more than 3 dimensions. We will use the Zeisel et al. (2015) dataset to demonstrate the applications of various dimensionality reduction methods in this chapter.

This is best understood by imagining each axis as a line. Say we draw a line anywhere, and we move all cells in our data set onto this line by the shortest path. The variance captured by this axis is defined as the variance across cells along that line. In PCA, the first axis (or “principal component”, PC) is chosen such that it captures the greatest variance across cells. The next PC is chosen such that it is orthogonal to the first and captures the greatest remaining amount of variation, and so on. By definition, the top PCs capture the dominant factors of heterogeneity in the data set. Thus, we can perform dimensionality reduction by restricting downstream analyses to the top PCs. This strategy is simple, highly effective and widely used throughout the data sciences. It takes advantage of the well-studied theoretical properties of the PCA - namely, that a low-rank approximation formed from the top PCs is the optimal approximation of the original data for a given matrix rank. It also allows us to use a wide range of fast PCA implementations for scalable and efficient data analysis. When applying PCA to scRNA-seq data, our assumption is that biological processes affect multiple genes in a coordinated manner. This means the the earlier PCs are likely to represent biological structure as more variation can be captured by considering the correlated behaviour of many genes. By comparison, random (technical) noise is expected to affect each gene independently. There is unlikely to be an axis that can capture random variation across many genes, suggesting that noise is mostly concentrated in the later PCs. This motivates the use of the earlier PCs in our downstream analyses, which concentrates the biological signal to simultaneously reduce computational work and remove noise. 11.2.2 Performing the PCA We perform the PCA on the log-normalized expression values using the HVGs we selected earlier. By restricting to the HVGs, we reduce computational work and noise to improve the performance of the PCA. (While PCA is robust to noise, an excess of it may cause the earlier PCs to capture noise instead of biological structure.) The runPCA() function from scater will compute the PCA and store the coordinates in the output object. library(scater) sce.zeisel &lt;- runPCA(sce.zeisel, subset_row=chosen.hvgs) reducedDimNames(sce.zeisel) ## [1] &quot;PCA&quot; The PCA is based on a mathematical technique called the singular decomposition decomposition (SVD). By default, runPCA() will use an exact SVD based on base R’s svd() function. It then only keeps the first 50 PCs for downstream analysis. dim(reducedDim(sce.zeisel, &quot;PCA&quot;)) ## [1] 3005 50 For large data sets, greater efficiency is obtained by using approximate SVD algorithms that only compute the top PCs. For example, we can use methods from the irlba package: library(BiocSingular) set.seed(1000) sce.zeisel &lt;- runPCA(sce.zeisel, subset_row=chosen.hvgs, BSPARAM=IrlbaParam(), name=&quot;IRLBA&quot;) reducedDimNames(sce.zeisel) ## [1] &quot;PCA&quot; &quot;IRLBA&quot; The BSPARAM= argument from BiocSingular provides a flexible interface for specifying different SVD algorithms. Any function that accepts a BSPARAM= argument can often be sped up by using an alternative SVD algorithm. Another strategy is to perform the SVD using methods from the rsvd package: set.seed(1001) # Slightly different seed to add some variety! sce.zeisel &lt;- runPCA(sce.zeisel, subset_row=chosen.hvgs, BSPARAM=RandomParam(), name=&quot;RSVD&quot;) reducedDimNames(sce.zeisel) ## [1] &quot;PCA&quot; &quot;IRLBA&quot; &quot;RSVD&quot; The majority of these approximate methods are based on randomization and thus require set.seed() to obtain reproducible results11. 11.2.3 Choosing the number of PCs 11.2.3.1 Motivation How many of the top PCs should we retain for downstream analyses? The choice of the number of PCs \\(d\\) is a decision that is analogous to the choice of the number of HVGs to use. Using more PCs will avoid discarding biological signal in later PCs, at the cost of retaining more noise. Most practitioners will simply set \\(d\\) to a “reasonable” but arbitrary value, typically ranging from 10 to 50. This is often satisfactory12 provided it is coupled with sufficient testing of alternative values to explore other perspectives of the data at a different bias-variance trade-off. Nonetheless, we will describe some more data-driven strategies to guide a suitable choice of \\(d\\). 11.2.3.2 Using the elbow point A simple heuristic for choosing \\(d\\) involves identifying the elbow point in the percentage of variance explained by successive PCs. This refers to the “elbow” in the curve of a scree plot as shown in Figure 11.1. # Percentage of variance explained is tucked away in the attributes. percent.var &lt;- attr(reducedDim(sce.zeisel), &quot;percentVar&quot;) chosen.elbow &lt;- PCAtools::findElbowPoint(percent.var) chosen.elbow ## [1] 6 plot(percent.var, xlab=&quot;PC&quot;, ylab=&quot;Variance explained (%)&quot;) abline(v=chosen.elbow, col=&quot;red&quot;) Figure 11.1: Percentage of variance explained by successive PCs in the Zeisel brain data. The identified elbow point is marked with a red line. Our assumption is that each of the top PCs capturing biological signal should explain much more variance than the remaining PCs. Thus, there should be a sharp drop in the percentage of variance explained when we move past the last “biological” PC. This manifests as an elbow in the scree plot, the location of which serves as a natural choice for \\(d\\). From a practical perspective, the use of the elbow point tends to retain fewer PCs compared to other methods. The definition of “much more variance” is relative so, in order to be retained, later PCs must explain a amount of variance that is comparable to that explained by the first few PCs. Strong biological variation in the early PCs will shift the elbow to the left, potentially excluding weaker (but still interesting) variation in the next PCs immediately following the elbow. 11.2.3.3 Using the technical noise Another strategy is to retain all PCs until the percentage of total variation explained reaches some threshold \\(T\\). For example, one might retain the top set of PCs that explains 80% of the total variation in the data. Of course, it would be pointless to swap one arbitrary parameter \\(d\\) for another \\(T\\). Instead, we define \\(T\\) as the proportion of variance in the data that is attributed to the biological component. This is done using the denoisePCA() function, which uses our estimates from modelGeneVar() (or related functions) to determine \\(d\\). library(scran) set.seed(001001001) # Setting max.rank=200 to circumvent the default max of 100. # Also setting BSPARAM to perform a fast SVD with IRLBA. denoised &lt;- denoisePCA(sce.zeisel, technical=dec.zeisel, subset.row=chosen.hvgs, BSPARAM=IrlbaParam(), max.rank=200) ncol(reducedDim(denoised)) ## [1] 100 This choice of \\(d\\) represents the lower bound on the number of PCs required to retain all biological variation. Any fewer PCs will definitely discard variance in the biological component. In reality, the choice returned by denoisePCA() will only be optimal if the early PCs capture all the biological signal with minimal noise. This is unlikely to be true as the PCA cannot distinguish between technical noise and weak biological signal in the later PCs. From a practical perspective, the denoisePCA() approach retains more PCs than the elbow point method. This is because the former does not compare PCs to each other and thus does not discard PCs corresponding to secondary factors of variation. Whether this is a “better” outcome depends on the analyst’s willingness to increase noise in order to preserve weaker biological signals. 11.2.3.4 Based on population structure Yet another choice for \\(d\\) uses information about the number of subpopulations in the data. We assume that each subpopulation differs from the others along a different axis in the high-dimensional space. This suggests that we should set \\(d\\) to the number of unique subpopulations minus 1. By doing so, we guarantee separation of all subpopulations while retaining as few dimensions (and noise) as possible. The number of subpopulations is usually not known in advance so instead we use the number of clusters as a proxy. However, this is itself dependent on the choice of \\(d\\) as clustering is often performed on the PCs (see Chapter ???). To handle this circularity, we test multiple choices for \\(d\\) and we pick a value that is closest to the number of clusters minus 1. This aims to achieve self-consistency in the number of PCs and clusters based on the reasoning above. pcs &lt;- reducedDim(sce.zeisel) n &lt;- seq(10, 20, by=1) collected &lt;- integer(0) # Using graph-based clustering here, but this can be # replaced with any clustering method of choice, provided # that the method determines the number of clusters by itself. for (i in n) { g &lt;- buildSNNGraph(pcs[,seq_len(i)], transposed=TRUE) clust &lt;- igraph::cluster_walktrap(g)$membership collected &lt;- c(collected, length(unique(clust))) } data.frame(n.pcs=n, n.clusters=collected) ## n.pcs n.clusters ## 1 10 17 ## 2 11 17 ## 3 12 16 ## 4 13 15 ## 5 14 15 ## 6 15 17 ## 7 16 14 ## 8 17 14 ## 9 18 14 ## 10 19 14 ## 11 20 14 n[collected-1==n] ## [1] 14 This strategy is the most pragmatic as it directly addresses the role of the bias-variance trade-off in downstream analyses. There is no need to preserve biological signal beyond what is distinguishable in later steps. However, it involves strong assumptions about the nature of the biological differences between subpopulations - and indeed, discrete subpopulations may not even exist in studies of continuous processes like differentiation. 11.2.4 Putting it together Once we have chosen \\(d\\), enforcing it is as simple as subsetting the PC matrix by column. We then use the reducedDim()&lt;- command to reassign the subsetted matrix back into the SingleCellExperiment object. For example, if we were to take the top 20 PCs, we would do: reducedDim(sce.zeisel, &quot;PCA&quot;) &lt;- reducedDim(sce.zeisel, &quot;PCA&quot;)[,1:20] ncol(reducedDim(sce.zeisel, &quot;PCA&quot;)) ## [1] 20 Downstream applications that use the &quot;PCA&quot; dimensionality reduction results in sce.zeisel will subsequently operate on the first 20 PCs only. Alternatively, some users may prefer to keep the full set of PCs, in which case the top set can be assigned to another name: reducedDim(sce.zeisel, &quot;PCA_20&quot;) &lt;- reducedDim(sce.zeisel, &quot;PCA&quot;)[,1:20] reducedDimNames(sce.zeisel) ## [1] &quot;PCA&quot; &quot;IRLBA&quot; &quot;RSVD&quot; &quot;PCA_20&quot; 11.3 Dimensionality reduction for visualization 11.3.1 Motivation Another application of dimensionality reduction is to compress the data into 2 (sometimes 3) dimensions for plotting. This serves a separate purpose to the PCA-based dimensionality reduction described above. Algorithms are more than happy to operate on 10-50 PCs, but these are still too many dimensions for human comprehension. Further dimensionality reduction strategies are required to pack the most salient features of the data into 2 or 3 dimensions, which we will discuss below. 11.3.2 Visualizating with PCA The simplest visualization approach is to plot the top 2 PCs (Figure 11.2): plotReducedDim(sce.zeisel, dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;, colour_by=&quot;level1class&quot;) Figure 11.2: PCA plot of the first two PCs in the Zeisel brain data. Each point is a cell, coloured according to the annotation provided by the original authors. The problem is that PCA is a linear technique, i.e., only variation along a line in high-dimensional space is captured by each PC. As such, it cannot efficiently pack differences in \\(d\\) dimensions into the first 2 PCs. This is demonstrated in Figure 11.2 where the top two PCs fail to resolve some subpopulations identified by Zeisel et al. (2015). If the first PC is devoted to resolving the biggest difference between subpopulations, and the second PC is devoted to resolving the next biggest difference, then the remaining differences will not be visible in the plot. One workaround is to plot several of the top PCs against each other in pairwise plots (Figure 11.3). However, it is difficult to interpret multiple plots simultaneously, and even this approach is not sufficient to separate some of the annotated subpopulations. plotReducedDim(sce.zeisel, dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;, ncomponents=4, colour_by=&quot;level1class&quot;) Figure 11.3: PCA plot of the first two PCs in the Zeisel brain data. Each point is a cell, coloured according to the annotation provided by the original authors. There are some advantages to the PCA for visualization. It is predictable and will not introduce artificial structure in the visualization. It is also deterministic and robust to small changes in the input values. However, as shown above, PCA is usually not satisfactory for visualization of complex populations. 11.3.3 t-stochastic neighbor embedding The de facto standard for visualization of scRNA-seq data is the \\(t\\)-stochastic neighbour embedding (\\(t\\)-SNE) method (Van der Maaten and Hinton 2008). This attempts to find a low-dimensional representation of the data that preserves the distances between each point and its neighbours in the high-dimensional space. Unlike PCA, it is not restricted to linear transformations, nor is it obliged to accurately represent distances between distance populations. This means that it has much more freedom in how it arranges cells in low-dimensional space, enabling it to separate many distinct clusters in a complex population (Figure 11.4). set.seed(00101001101) sce.zeisel &lt;- runTSNE(sce.zeisel, dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;) plotReducedDim(sce.zeisel, dimred=&quot;TSNE&quot;, colour_by=&quot;level1class&quot;) Figure 11.4: \\(t\\)-SNE plots constructed from the top PCs in the Zeisel brain dataset. Each point represents a cell, coloured according to the published annotation. One of the main disadvantages of \\(t\\)-SNE is that it is much more computationally intensive than other visualization methods. We mitigate this effect by performing the calculations on the top PCs with dimred=&quot;PCA&quot; in runtTSNE(). This takes advantage of the PCA to compact the data and remove noise, followed by \\(t\\)-SNE to create the visualization. It is possible to run \\(t\\)-SNE on the original expression matrix but this is less efficient. Another issue with \\(t\\)-SNE is that it requires the user to be aware of additional parameters (discussed here in some depth). It involves a random initialization so we need to set the seed to ensure that the chosen results are reproducible. The “perplexity” is another important parameter that determines the granularity of the visualization (Figure 11.5). Low perplexities will favour resolution of finer structure, possibly to the point that the visualization is compromised by random noise. Thus, it is advisable to test different perplexity values to ensure that the choice of perplexity does not drive the interpretation of the plot. set.seed(100) sce.zeisel &lt;- runTSNE(sce.zeisel, dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;, perplexity=5) out5 &lt;- plotReducedDim(sce.zeisel, dimred=&quot;TSNE&quot;, colour_by=&quot;level1class&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;perplexity = 5&quot;) set.seed(100) sce.zeisel &lt;- runTSNE(sce.zeisel, dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;, perplexity=20) out20 &lt;- plotReducedDim(sce.zeisel, dimred=&quot;TSNE&quot;, colour_by=&quot;level1class&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;perplexity = 20&quot;) set.seed(100) sce.zeisel &lt;- runTSNE(sce.zeisel, dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;, perplexity=80) out80 &lt;- plotReducedDim(sce.zeisel, dimred=&quot;TSNE&quot;, colour_by=&quot;level1class&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;perplexity = 80&quot;) multiplot(out5, out20, out80, cols=3) Figure 11.5: \\(t\\)-SNE plots constructed from the top PCs in the Zeisel brain dataset, using a range of perplexity values. Each point represents a cell, coloured according to its annotation. Despite its shortcomings, \\(t\\)-SNE is proven tool for general-purpose visualization of scRNA-seq data. It sees routine use in many analysis pipelines and will likely continue to do so for some time. 11.3.4 Uniform manifold approximation and projection The uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) method (???) is an alternative to \\(t\\)-SNE for non-linear dimensionality reduction. It is roughly similar to \\(t\\)-SNE in that it also tries to find a low-dimensional representation that preserves relationships between neighbors in high-dimensional space. However, the two methods are based on different theory, represented by differences in the various graph weighting equations13. This manifests as a different visualization as shown in Figure 11.6. set.seed(1100101001) sce.zeisel &lt;- runUMAP(sce.zeisel, dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;) plotReducedDim(sce.zeisel, dimred=&quot;UMAP&quot;, colour_by=&quot;level1class&quot;) Figure 11.6: UMAP plots constructed from the top PCs in the Zeisel brain dataset. Each point represents a cell, coloured according to the published annotation. Compared to \\(t\\)-SNE, the UMAP visualization tends to have more compact visual clusters with more empty space between them. It also attempts to preserve more of the global structure than \\(t\\)-SNE. From a practical perspective, UMAP is much faster than \\(t\\)-SNE, which may be an important consideration for large datasets. (Nonetheless, we have still run UMAP on the top 20 PCs here for consistency.) UMAP also involves a series of randomization steps so setting the seed is critical. Like \\(t\\)-SNE, UMAP has its own suite of hyperparameters that affect the visualization. Of these, the number of neighbours (n_neighbors) and the minimum distance between embedded points (min_dist) have the greatest effect on the granularity of the output. If these values are too low, random noise will be incorrectly treated as high-resolution structure, while values that are too high will discard fine structure altogether in favour of obtaining an accurate overview of the entire dataset. Again, it is a good idea to test a range of values for these parameters to ensure that they do not compromise any conclusions drawn from a UMAP plot. It is arguable whether the UMAP or \\(t\\)-SNE visualizations are more useful or aesthetically pleasing. However, it is clear that UMAP is much faster. For that reason alone, it is increasingly displacing \\(t\\)-SNE as the method of choice for visualizing large scRNA-seq data sets. 11.3.5 Interpreting the plots Dimensionality reduction for visualization necessarily involves discarding information and distorting the distances between cells. One might then ask whether the results of such extreme data compression can be trusted. Indeed, it would probably be unwise to directly analyze the low-dimensional coordinates used for plotting. Rather, the plots should be used to interpret/communicate the results of quantitative analyses based on a more accurate higher-rank representation of the data. To illustrate, consider the interaction between clustering and \\(t\\)-SNE. As a general rule, we would not perform clustering on the \\(t\\)-SNE coordinates. Rather, we would cluster on the first 10-50 PCs (see Chapter ???) and then visualize the cluster identities on the \\(t\\)-SNE plot. This ensures that clustering makes use of the information that was lost during compression into two dimensions. Given a discrepancy between the visible clusters on a \\(t\\)-SNE plot and those identified by our clustering, we would be inclined to favour the latter.

Its primary purpose is to summarize the data in a digestible format for human interpretation. This allows us to describe population heterogeneity in terms of discrete labels that are easily understood, rather than attempting to comprehend the high-dimensional manifold on which the cells truly reside. After annotation based on marker genes, the clusters can be treated as proxies for more abstract biological concepts such as cell types or states. Clustering is thus a critical step for extracting biological insights from scRNA-seq data. Here, we demonstrate the application of several commonly used methods with the 10X PBMC dataset.

The former is an empirical construct while the latter is a biological truth (albeit a vaguely defined one). For this reason, questions like “what is the true number of clusters?” are usually meaningless. We can define as many clusters as we like, with whatever algorithm we like - each clustering will represent its own partitioning of the high-dimensional expression space, and is as “real” as any other clustering. A more relevant question is “how well do the clusters approximate the cell types?” Unfortunately, this is difficult to answer given the context-dependent interpretation of biological truth. Some analysts will be satisfied with resolution of the major cell types; other analysts may want resolution of subtypes; and others still may require resolution of different states (e.g., metabolic activity, stress) within those subtypes. Two clusterings can also be highly inconsistent yet both valid, simply partitioning the cells based on different aspects of biology. Indeed, asking for an unqualified “best” clustering is akin to asking for the best magnification on a microscope without any context. It is helpful to realize that clustering, like a microscope, is simply a tool to explore the data. We can zoom in and out by changing the resolution of the clustering parameters, and we can experiment with different clustering algorithms to obtain alternative perspectives of the data. This iterative approach is entirely permissible for data exploration, which constitutes the majority of all scRNA-seq data analysis. 12.3 Graph-based clustering 12.3.1 Background Popularized by its use in Seurat, graph-based clustering is a flexible and scalable technique for clustering large scRNA-seq datasets. We first build a graph where each node is a cell that is connected to its nearest neighbours in the high-dimensional space. Edges are weighted based on the similarity between the cells involved, with higher weight given to cells that are more closely related. We then apply algorithms to identify “communities” of cells that are more connected to cells in the same community than they are to cells of different communities. Each community represents a cluster that we can use for downstream interpretation. The major advantage of graph-based clustering lies in its scalability. It only requires a \\(k\\)-nearest neighbor search that can be done in log-linear time on average, in contrast to hierachical clustering methods with runtimes that are quadratic with respect to the number of cells. Graph construction avoids making strong assumptions about the shape of the clusters or the distribution of cells within each cluster, compared to other methods like \\(k\\)-means (that favor spherical clusters) or Gaussian mixture models (that require normality). From a practical perspective, each cell is forcibly connected to a minimum number of neighboring cells, which reduces the risk of generating many uninformative clusters consisting of one or two outlier cells. The main drawback of graph-based methods is that, after graph construction, no information is retained about relationships beyond the neighbouring cells15. This has some practical consequences in datasets that exhibit differences in cell density, as more steps through the graph are required to move the same distance through a region of higher cell density. From the perspective of community detection algorithms, this effect “inflates” the high-density regions such that any internal substructure or noise is more likely to cause formation of subclusters. The resolution of clustering thus becomes dependent on the density of cells, which can occasionally be misleading if it overstates the heterogeneity in the data. 12.3.2 Implementation There are several considerations in the practical execution of a graph-based clustering method: How many neighbors are considered when constructing the graph. What scheme is used to weight the edges. Which community detection algorithm is used to define the clusters. For example, the following code uses the 10 nearest neighbors of each cell to construct a shared nearest neighbor graph. Two cells are connected by an edge if any of their nearest neighbors are shared, with the edge weight defined from the highest average rank of the shared neighbors (Xu and Su 2015). The Walktrap method from the igraph package is then used to identify communities. All calculations are performed using the top PCs to take advantage of data compression and denoising. library(scran) g &lt;- buildSNNGraph(sce.pbmc, k=10, use.dimred = &#39;PCA&#39;) clust &lt;- igraph::cluster_walktrap(g)$membership table(clust) ## clust ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ## 841 506 327 175 127 411 198 952 22 86 103 91 47 36 We assign the cluster assignments back into our SingleCellExperiment object as a factor in the column metadata.

The most important parameter is k, the number of nearest neighbors used to construct the graph. This controls the resolution of the clustering with higher k yielding a more inter-connected graph and larger clusters. Users can exploit this by experimenting with different values of k to obtain a satisfactory resolution. # More resolved. g.5 &lt;- buildSNNGraph(sce.pbmc, k=5, use.dimred = &#39;PCA&#39;) clust.5 &lt;- igraph::cluster_walktrap(g.5)$membership table(clust.5) ## clust.5 ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ## 40 432 394 206 607 182 18 88 173 835 26 58 204 71 98 83 115 166 ## 19 20 21 22 23 ## 46 11 19 14 36 # Less resolved. g.50 &lt;- buildSNNGraph(sce.pbmc, k=50, use.dimred = &#39;PCA&#39;) clust.50 &lt;- igraph::cluster_walktrap(g.50)$membership table(clust.50) ## clust.50 ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## 121 227 831 1091 198 106 469 503 47 329 12.3.3 Other parameters Further tweaking can be performed by changing the edge weighting scheme during graph construction. Setting type=&quot;number&quot; will weight edges based on the number of nearest neighbors that are shared between two cells. Similarly, type=&quot;jaccard&quot; will weight edges according to the Jaccard index of the two sets of neighbors. We can also disable weighting altogether by using buildKNNGraph(), which is occasionally useful for downstream graph operations that do not support weights. g.num &lt;- buildSNNGraph(sce.pbmc, use.dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;, type=&quot;number&quot;) g.jaccard &lt;- buildSNNGraph(sce.pbmc, use.dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;, type=&quot;jaccard&quot;) g.none &lt;- buildKNNGraph(sce.pbmc, use.dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;) All of these g variables are graph objects from the igraph package and can be used with any of the community detection algorithms provided by igraph.

For example, the results below suggest that Louvain is similar to Walktrap; fast-greedy yields coarser clusters; and Infomap provides higher resolution. table(Louvain=clust.louvain, Walktrap=clust) ## Walktrap ## Louvain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ## 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 47 0 ## 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 196 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 36 ## 4 0 1 0 161 0 150 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 5 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 22 0 0 0 0 0 ## 6 0 0 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 85 103 0 0 0 ## 7 0 0 0 0 126 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 8 0 0 323 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ## 9 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 825 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 10 172 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 91 0 0 ## 11 0 1 0 0 0 258 0 105 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 12 669 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 13 0 504 0 0 0 3 2 22 0 0 0 0 0 0 table(Infomap=clust.infomap, Walktrap=clust) ## Walktrap ## Infomap 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ## 1 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 844 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 2 447 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 3 0 0 0 0 0 236 0 57 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 4 0 0 204 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 5 204 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 173 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 7 0 117 0 0 0 1 0 50 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 8 0 168 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 9 0 0 0 159 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 10 0 0 0 0 127 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 11 0 0 0 0 0 131 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 12 0 0 118 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 ## 13 0 111 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 14 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 102 0 0 0 ## [ reached getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 14 rows ] table(Fast=clust.fast, Walktrap=clust) ## Walktrap ## Fast 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ## 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 36 ## 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 46 0 ## 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 190 0 18 0 0 0 0 0 ## 4 0 504 0 133 0 155 7 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 ## 5 0 1 327 0 0 0 1 0 1 86 103 0 0 0 ## 6 0 1 0 42 0 256 0 952 1 0 0 0 0 0 ## 7 841 0 0 0 127 0 0 0 0 0 0 91 1 0 Pipelines involving scran default to rank-based weights followed by Walktrap clustering. In contrast, Seurat uses Jaccard-based weights followed by Louvain clustering. Both of these strategies work well, and it is likely that the same could be said for many other combinations of weighting schemes and community detection algorithms. 12.3.4 Assessing cluster separation When dealing with graphs, the modularity is a natural metric for evaluating the separation between communities/clusters. This is defined as the (scaled) difference between the observed total weight of edges between nodes in the same cluster and the expected total weight if edge weights were randomly distributed across all pairs of nodes. Larger modularity values indicate that there most edges occur within clusters, suggesting that the clusters are sufficiently well separated to avoid edges forming between neighboring cells in different clusters. The standard approach is to report a single modularity value for a clustering on a given graph. This is useful for comparing different clusterings on the same graph - and indeed, some community detection algorithms are designed with the aim of maximizing the modularity - but it is less helpful for interpreting a given clustering. Rather, we use the clusterModularity() function with get.values=TRUE, which returns the observed and expected sum of weights between each pair of clusters. mod &lt;- clusterModularity(g, clust, get.values=TRUE) names(mod) ## [1] &quot;observed&quot; &quot;expected&quot; mod$observed ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## 1 219592 0 0 0.0 1775.0 0 0 7.0 0.0 0 ## 2 0 106220 79 40.5 0.0 5368 551 5044.0 152.0 18 ## 3 0 0 75099 0.0 0.0 0 115 0.0 83.5 2426 ## 4 0 0 0 34432.0 55.5 5093 0 11198.0 177.5 124 ## 5 0 0 0 0.0 18273.0 0 0 0.0 4.0 0 ## 6 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 86193 0 19856.0 64.5 0 ## 7 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 41199 13.5 143.0 32 ## 8 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 0 318407.5 75.0 0 ## 9 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 0 0.0 1593.0 0 ## 10 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 0 0.0 0.0 13806 ## 11 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 ## 12 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 ## 13 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 ## 14 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 ## 11 12 13 14 ## 1 0 1586 62.5 0 ## 2 0 0 0.0 0 ## 3 2428 0 0.0 0 ## 4 0 0 0.0 0 ## 5 0 0 0.0 0 ## 6 0 0 0.0 0 ## 7 0 0 0.0 0 ## 8 0 0 0.0 0 ## 9 0 0 0.0 0 ## 10 3058 0 0.0 0 ## 11 19540 0 0.0 0 ## 12 0 15168 0.0 0 ## 13 0 0 5820.5 0 ## 14 0 0 0.0 4334 In each matrix, each row/column corresponds to a cluster, and each entry of the matrix contains the total weight of edges between cells in the respective clusters. A dataset containing well-separated clusters should contain most of the observed total weight on the diagonal entries, i.e., most edges occur between cells in the same cluster. We visualize this by computing the log-ratio of observed to expected weights (Figure 12.2). Concentration of the weight on the diagonal indicates that most of the clusters are well-separated, while some modest off-diagonal entries represent closely related clusters with more inter-connecting edges. (We use the log-ratio instead of the difference as the latter’s scale depends on the number of cells in each cluster, meaning that any visualization would be dominated by large differences for large clusters.) ratio &lt;- mod$observed/mod$expected library(pheatmap) pheatmap(log2(ratio+1), cluster_rows=FALSE, cluster_cols=FALSE, color=colorRampPalette(c(&quot;white&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;))(100)) Figure 12.2: Heatmap of the log2-ratio of the total weight between nodes in the same cluster or in different clusters, relative to the total weight expected under a null model of random links. One useful approach is to use the ratio matrix to form another graph where the nodes are clusters rather than cells. Edges between nodes are weighted according to the ratio of observed to expected edge weights between cells in those clusters. We can then repeat our graph operations on this new cluster-level graph. For example, we could obtain clusters of clusters, or we could simply create a new cluster-based layout for visualization (Figure 12.3). This is analogous to the “graph abstraction” approach described by Wolf et al. (2017). cluster.gr &lt;- igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(ratio, mode=&quot;undirected&quot;, weighted=TRUE, diag=FALSE) plot(cluster.gr, edge.width=igraph::E(cluster.gr)$weight*10) Figure 12.3: Force-directed layout showing the relationships between clusters based on the ratio of observed to expected total weights between nodes in different clusters. The thickness of the edge between a pair of clusters is proportional to the corresponding ratio. Incidentally, some readers may have noticed that all igraph commands were prefixed with igraph::. We have done this deliberately to avoid bringing igraph::normalize into the global namespace. Rather unfortunately, this normalize function accepts any argument and returns NULL, which causes difficult-to-diagnose bugs when it overwrites our intended normalize from scater. 12.4 \\(k\\)-means clustering 12.4.1 Background \\(k\\)-means clustering is a classic technique that aims to partition cells into \\(k\\) clusters. Each cell is assigned to the cluster with the closest centroid, which is done by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares using a random starting configuration for the \\(k\\) centroids. The main advantage of this approach lies in its speed, given the simplicity and ease of implementation of the algorithm. However, it suffers from a number of serious shortcomings: It implicitly favours spherical clusters of equal radius. This can result in inappropriate partitionings on real datasets that contain groupings with irregular sizes and shapes. The number of clusters \\(k\\) must be specified beforehand and represents a hard cap on the resolution of the clustering.. For example, setting \\(k\\) to be below the number of cell types will always lead to co-clustering of two cell types, regardless of how well separated they are. In contrast, other methods like graph-based clustering will respect strong separation even if the relevant resolution parameter is set to a low value. It is dependent on the randomly chosen initial coordinates. This requires multiple runs to verify that the clustering is stable. These issues reduce the appeal of \\(k\\)-means clustering for scRNA-seq data analysis. Despite this, it is still used widely as it is fast and - frankly - often good enough. Even if we were to forgo \\(k\\)-means for obtaining clusters to interpret, it is still one of the best approaches for sample-based data compression. In this application, we set \\(k\\) to a large value such as the square root of the number of cells to obtain fine-grained clusters. These are not meant to be interpreted directly, but rather, the centroids are treated as “samples” for further analyses. The idea here is to obtain a single representative of each region of the expression space, reducing the number of samples and computational work in later steps like, e.g., trajectory reconstruction (Ji and Ji 2016). This approach will also eliminate differences in cell density across the expression space, ensuring that the most abundant cell type does not dominate downstream results. 12.4.2 Base implementation Base R provides the kmeans() function that does as its name suggests. We call this on our top PCs to obtain a clustering for a specified number of clusters in the centers= argument, after setting the random seed to ensure that the results are reproducible. In general, the \\(k\\)-means clusters correspond to the visual clusters on the \\(t\\)-SNE plot in Figure 12.4, though there are some divergences that are not observed in, say, Figure 12.1. (This is at least partially due to the fact that \\(t\\)-SNE is itself graph-based and so will naturally agree more with a graph-based clustering strategy.) set.seed(100) clust.kmeans &lt;- kmeans(reducedDim(sce.pbmc, &quot;PCA&quot;), centers=10) table(clust.kmeans$cluster) ## ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## 377 202 47 556 311 503 271 262 1056 337 sce.pbmc$cluster &lt;- factor(clust.kmeans$cluster) plotReducedDim(sce.pbmc, &quot;TSNE&quot;, colour_by=&quot;cluster&quot;) Figure 12.4: \\(t\\)-SNE plot of the 10X PBMC dataset, where each point represents a cell and is coloured according to the identity of the assigned cluster from \\(k\\)-means clustering. We obtain a “reasonable” choice of \\(k\\) by computing the gap statistic using methods from the cluster package. This is the log-ratio of the expected to observed within-cluster sum of squares, where the expected value is computed by randomly distributingn cells throughout high-dimensional space using the bounding box of the original data. A larger gap statistic represents a lower observed sum of squares - and thus better clustering - compared to a population with no structure. Ideally, we would choose the \\(k\\) that maximizes the gap statistic, but this is often unhelpful as the tendency of \\(k\\)-means to favour spherical clusters results in a large choice \\(k\\) to capture different cluster shapes. Instead, we choose the most parsimonious \\(k\\) beyond which the increases in the gap statistic are considered insignificant (Figure 12.5). library(cluster) gaps &lt;- clusGap(reducedDim(sce.pbmc, &quot;PCA&quot;), kmeans, K.max=20) best.k &lt;- maxSE(gaps$Tab[,&quot;gap&quot;], gaps$Tab[,&quot;SE.sim&quot;]) best.k ## [1] 3 plot(gaps$Tab[,&quot;gap&quot;], xlab=&quot;Number of clusters&quot;, ylab=&quot;Gap statistic&quot;) abline(v=best.k, col=&quot;red&quot;) Figure 12.5: Gap statistic with respect to increasing number of \\(k\\)-means clusters in the 10X PBMC dataset.

Here, \\(k\\) is chosen based on the gap statistic. 12.4.3 Assessing cluster separation The within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for each cluster is the relevant diagnostic for \\(k\\)-means, given that the algorithm aims to find a clustering that minimizes the WCSS. Specifically, we use the WCSS to compute the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) that represents the spread of cells within each cluster. A cluster is more likely to have a low RMSD if it has no internal structure and is separated from other clusters (such that there are not many cells on the boundaries between clusters, which results in a higher sum of squares from the centroid). ncells &lt;- tabulate(clust.kmeans2$cluster) tab &lt;- data.frame(wcss=clust.kmeans2$withinss, ncells=ncells) tab$rms &lt;- sqrt(tab$wcss/tab$ncells) tab ## wcss ncells rms ## 1 192892 2084 9.621 ## 2 88951 780 10.679 ## 3 73934 1058 8.359 As an aside, clusters with the largest RMSD appear to be the least dispersed in Figure ??. This highlights the risks of attempting to quantitatively interpret \\(t\\)-SNE plots. To explore the relationships between \\(k\\)-means clusters, a natural approach is to compute distances between their centroids. This directly lends itself to visualization as a tree after hierarchical clustering (Figure 12.7). cent.tree &lt;- hclust(dist(clust.kmeans2$centers), &quot;ward.D2&quot;) plot(cent.tree) Figure 12.7: Hierarchy of \\(k\\)-means cluster centroids, using Ward’s minimum variance method. 12.5 Hierarchical clustering 12.5.1 Background Hierarchical clustering is an ancient technique that aims to generate a dendrogram containing a hierarchy of samples. This is most commonly done by greedily agglomerating samples into clusters, then agglomerating those clusters into larger clusters, and so on until all samples belong to a single cluster. Variants of hierarchical clustering methods primarily differ in how they choose to perform the agglomerations. For example, complete linkage aims to merge clusters with the smallest maximum distance between their elements, while Ward’s method aims to minimize the increase in within-cluster variance. In the context of scRNA-seq, the main advantage of hierarchical clustering lies in the production of the dendrogram. This is a rich summary that describes not only the relationships between cells but also the relationships between clusters at varying resolution. Users can easily “cut” the tree at different heights to define clusters with different granularity, where clusters defined at high resolution are guaranteed to be nested within those defined at a lower resolution. The dendrogram is also a natural representation of the data in situations where cells have descended from a relatively recent common ancestor. In practice, hierachical clustering is too slow to be used for anything but the smallest scRNA-seq datasets. Most variants require a cell-cell distance matrix that is prohibitively expensive to compute for many cells. Greedy agglomeration is also likely to result in a quantitatively suboptimal partitioning (as defined by the agglomeration measure) at higher levels of the dendrogram when the number of cells and merge steps is high. Nonetheless, we will still demonstrate the application of hierarchical clustering here, as it is useful for squeezing more information out of datasets with very few cells16. 12.5.2 Implementation As the PBMC dataset is too large, we will demonstrate on the 416B dataset instead.

To obtain explicit clusters, we “cut” the tree by removing internal branches such that every subtree represents a distinct cluster. This is most simply done by removing internal branches above a certain height of the tree, as performed by the cutree() function.

For each cell, we compute the average distance to cells in each other cluster. We then compute the minimum of these average distances across all clusters, as well as the average distance to cells in the same cluster. The silhouette width for each cell is defined as the difference between these two values divided by their maximum. Cells with large positive silhouette widths are closer to other cells in the same cluster than to cells in different clusters. Each cluster would ideally contain large positive silhouette widths, indicating that it is well-separated from other clusters. In Figure 12.11, some clusters are well-separated while others have a substantial proportion of negative widths. These can arise from the presence of internal subclusters, which inflates the within-cluster distance; or overclustering, where cells at the boundary of a partition are closer to the neighboring cluster than their own cluster. sil &lt;- silhouette(clust.416b, dist = dist.416b) plot(sil) Figure 12.11: Silhouette widths for cells in each cluster in the 416B dataset. Each bar represents a cell, grouped by the cluster to which it is assigned. For a more detailed examination, we identify the closest neighboring cluster for cells with negative widths. This provides a perspective on the relationships between clusters that is closer to the raw data than the dendrogram in Figure 12.9. neg.widths &lt;- sil[,3] &lt; 0 table(Cluster=sil[neg.widths,1], Neighbor=sil[neg.widths,2]) ## Neighbor ## Cluster 2 3 4 ## 1 11 0 22 ## 2 0 16 0 The average silhouette width across all cells can also be used to choose clustering parameters. The aim is to maximize the average silhouette width in order to obtain well-separated clusters. This can be helpful to automatically obtain a “reasonable” clustering, though in practice, the clustering that yields the strongest separation is usually trivial and not biologically informative.

These marker genes allow us to assign biological meaning to each cluster based on their functional annotation. In the most obvious case, the marker genes for each cluster are a priori associated with particular cell types, allowing us to treat the clustering as a proxy for cell type identity. The same principle can be applied to more subtle differences in activation status or differentiation state. Identification of marker genes is usually based around the retrospective detection of differential expression between clusters. Genes that are more strongly DE are more likely to have driven cluster separation in the first place. Several different statistical tests are available to quantify the differences in expression profiles, and different approaches can be used to consolidate test results into a single ranking of genes for each cluster. These choices parametrize the theroetical differences between the various marker detection strategies presented in this chapter. We will demonstrate using the 10X PBMC dataset: View history ### loading ### library(BiocFileCache) bfc &lt;- BiocFileCache(&quot;raw_data&quot;, ask = FALSE) raw.path &lt;- bfcrpath(bfc, file.path(&quot;http://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples&quot;, &quot;cell-exp/2.1.0/pbmc4k/pbmc4k_raw_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz&quot;)) untar(raw.path, exdir=file.path(tempdir(), &quot;pbmc4k&quot;)) library(DropletUtils) fname &lt;- file.path(tempdir(), &quot;pbmc4k/raw_gene_bc_matrices/GRCh38&quot;) sce.pbmc &lt;- read10xCounts(fname, col.names=TRUE) ### gene-annotation ### library(scater) rownames(sce.pbmc) &lt;- uniquifyFeatureNames(rowData(sce.pbmc)$ID, rowData(sce.pbmc)$Symbol) library(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86) location &lt;- mapIds(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86, keys=rowData(sce.pbmc)$ID, column=&quot;SEQNAME&quot;, keytype=&quot;GENEID&quot;) ### cell-detection ### set.seed(100) e.out &lt;- emptyDrops(counts(sce.pbmc)) sce.pbmc &lt;- sce.pbmc[,which(e.out$FDR &lt;= 0.001)] ### quality-control ### sce.pbmc &lt;- calculateQCMetrics(sce.pbmc, feature_controls=list(Mito=which(location==&quot;MT&quot;))) high.mito &lt;- isOutlier(sce.pbmc$pct_counts_Mito, nmads=3, type=&quot;higher&quot;) sce.pbmc &lt;- sce.pbmc[,!high.mito] ### normalization ### library(scran) set.seed(1000) clusters &lt;- quickCluster(sce.pbmc) sce.pbmc &lt;- computeSumFactors(sce.pbmc, min.mean=0.1, cluster=clusters) sce.pbmc &lt;- normalize(sce.pbmc) ### feature-selection ### fit.pbmc &lt;- trendVar(sce.pbmc, use.spikes=FALSE) dec.pbmc &lt;- decomposeVar(fit=fit.pbmc) o &lt;- order(dec.pbmc$bio, decreasing=TRUE) chosen.hvgs &lt;- rownames(dec.pbmc)[head(o, 2000)] ### dimensionality-reduction ### set.seed(10000) sce.pbmc &lt;- runPCA(sce.pbmc, feature_set=chosen.hvgs, ncomponents=25, BSPARAM=BiocSingular::IrlbaParam()) set.seed(100000) sce.pbmc &lt;- runTSNE(sce.pbmc, use_dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;) set.seed(1000000) sce.pbmc &lt;- runUMAP(sce.pbmc, use_dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;) ### clustering ### g &lt;- buildSNNGraph(sce.pbmc, k=10, use.dimred = &#39;PCA&#39;) clust &lt;- igraph::cluster_walktrap(g)$membership sce.pbmc$cluster &lt;- factor(clust) sce.pbmc ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 33694 3922 ## metadata(1): log.exprs.offset ## assays(2): counts logcounts ## rownames(33694): RP11-34P13.3 FAM138A ...

It is quickly computed and has good statistical properties for large numbers of cells [soneson2018bias]. We use the findMarkers() function to perform pairwise comparisons between clusters for each gene. This yields a list of DataFrames contained ranked candidate markers for each cluster. library(scran) markers.pbmc &lt;- findMarkers(sce.pbmc, sce.pbmc$cluster) markers.pbmc ## DataFrameList of length 14 ## names(14): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 To demonstrate, we use cluster 13 as our cluster of interest for this section. The relevant DataFrame contains log2-fold changes of expression in cluster 13 over each other cluster, along with several statistics obtained by combining \\(p\\)-values (Simes 1986) across the pairwise comparisons involving 13. chosen &lt;- &quot;13&quot; interesting &lt;- markers.pbmc[[chosen]] colnames(interesting) ## [1] &quot;Top&quot; &quot;p.value&quot; &quot;FDR&quot; &quot;logFC.1&quot; &quot;logFC.2&quot; &quot;logFC.3&quot; ## [7] &quot;logFC.4&quot; &quot;logFC.5&quot; &quot;logFC.6&quot; &quot;logFC.7&quot; &quot;logFC.8&quot; &quot;logFC.9&quot; ## [13] &quot;logFC.10&quot; &quot;logFC.11&quot; &quot;logFC.12&quot; &quot;logFC.14&quot; Of particular interest is the Top field, which contains the highest17 rank for each gene across all pairwise comparisons involving cluster 13. The set of genes with Top values of 1 contains the gene with the lowest \\(p\\)-value from each comparison. Similarly, the set of genes with Top values less than or equal to 10 contains the top 10 genes from each comparison. Each DataFrame produced by findMarkers() will order genes based on the Top value. interesting[1:10,1:3] ## DataFrame with 10 rows and 3 columns ## Top p.value FDR ## &lt;integer&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## FCN1 1 0 0 ## TCF7 1 5.53461966076924e-212 4.66208687124901e-208 ## GZMA 1 2.66033221857026e-179 7.46976948104228e-176 ## TRAC 1 5.25329355206874e-171 1.36157286879541e-167 ## CD79A 1 3.6312669334308e-111 2.18485550098245e-108 ## HLA-DQA1 1 1.50661920177643e-102 6.59273082917604e-100 ## RPL17 1 3.56852788331596e-72 5.16042826182187e-70 ## SERPINA1 1 9.38144289259819e-66 1.09756366952502e-63 ## PF4 1 3.05262427368474e-34 1.02140141288514e-32 ## TAGLN2 1 6.20116906871191e-25 1.23051937927667e-23 ## &lt;integer&gt; ## 1 ## 1 ## 1 ## 1 ## 1 ## 1 ## 1 ## 1 ## 1 ## 1 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0 ## 5.53461966076924e-212 ## 2.66033221857026e-179 ## 5.25329355206874e-171 ## 3.6312669334308e-111 ## 1.50661920177643e-102 ## 3.56852788331596e-72 ## 9.38144289259819e-66 ## 3.05262427368474e-34 ## 6.20116906871191e-25 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0 ## 4.66208687124901e-208 ## 7.46976948104228e-176 ## 1.36157286879541e-167 ## 2.18485550098245e-108 ## 6.59273082917604e-100 ## 5.16042826182187e-70 ## 1.09756366952502e-63 ## 1.02140141288514e-32 ## 1.23051937927667e-23 We use the Top value to identify a set of genes that is guaranteed to distinguish cluster 13 from any other cluster. Here, we examine the top 5 genes from each pairwise comparison (Figure 13.1).

Colours are capped at -5 and 5 to preserve dynamic range. We intentionally use pairwise comparisons between clusters rather than comparing each cluster to the average of all other cells. The latter approach is sensitive to the population composition, potentially resulting in wildly different sets of markers when cell type abundances change in different contexts. In the worst case, the presence of a single dominant subpopulation will drive the selection of top markers for every other cluster, pushing out useful genes that can resolve the various minor subpopulations. Moreover, pairwise comparisons naturally provide more information to interpret of the utility of a marker, e.g., by providing log-fold changes to indicate which clusters are distinguished by this gene. 13.2.2 Using the log-fold change Our previous findMarkers() call considers both up- and downregulated genes to be potential markers. However, downregulated genes are less appealing as markers as it is more difficult to interpret and experimentally validate an absence of expression. To focus on up-regulated markers, we can instead perform a one-sided \\(t\\)-test to identify genes that are upregulated in each cluster compared to the others. This is achieved by setting direction=&quot;up&quot; in the findMarkers() call. markers.pbmc.up &lt;- findMarkers(sce.pbmc, sce.pbmc$cluster, direction=&quot;up&quot;) interesting.up &lt;- markers.pbmc.up[[chosen]] interesting.up[1:10,1:3] ## DataFrame with 10 rows and 3 columns ## Top p.value FDR ## &lt;integer&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## PF4 1 1.52631213684237e-34 5.14275611387667e-30 ## TAGLN2 1 3.10058453435595e-25 3.48236984335298e-21 ## TMSB4X 2 9.81337605504538e-28 1.65325946399349e-23 ## SDPR 2 3.01763170904665e-22 2.54190207011544e-18 ## GPX1 2 1.38548122900468e-21 9.33648090601676e-18 ## NRGN 3 1.71582179536885e-21 9.63548326219298e-18 ## PPBP 3 2.20536242960658e-21 1.06153545290234e-17 ## CCL5 5 2.44842379065852e-19 1.0312148900306e-15 ## GNG11 6 4.7543863415631e-19 1.77993659325141e-15 ## HIST1H2AC 7 1.53450655376556e-18 5.1703663822577e-15 ## &lt;integer&gt; ## 1 ## 1 ## 2 ## 2 ## 2 ## 3 ## 3 ## 5 ## 6 ## 7 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 1.52631213684237e-34 ## 3.10058453435595e-25 ## 9.81337605504538e-28 ## 3.01763170904665e-22 ## 1.38548122900468e-21 ## 1.71582179536885e-21 ## 2.20536242960658e-21 ## 2.44842379065852e-19 ## 4.7543863415631e-19 ## 1.53450655376556e-18 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 5.14275611387667e-30 ## 3.48236984335298e-21 ## 1.65325946399349e-23 ## 2.54190207011544e-18 ## 9.33648090601676e-18 ## 9.63548326219298e-18 ## 1.06153545290234e-17 ## 1.0312148900306e-15 ## 1.77993659325141e-15 ## 5.1703663822577e-15 The \\(t\\)-test also allows us to specify a non-zero log-fold change as the null hypothesis. This allows us to consider the magnitude of the log-fold change in our \\(p\\)-value calculations, in a manner that is more rigorous than simply filtering directly on the log-fold changes (McCarthy and Smyth 2009). (Specifically, a simple threshold does not consider the variance and can enrich for genes that have both large log-fold changes and large variances.)

Colours are capped at -5 and 5 to preserve dynamic range. Of course, this increased stringency is not without cost. If only upregulated genes are requested from findMarkers(), any cluster defined by downregulation of a marker gene will not contain that gene among the top set of features in its DataFrame. This is occasionally relevant for subtypes or other states that are distinguished by high versus low expression of particular genes18. Similarly, setting an excessively high log-fold change threshold may discard otherwise useful genes. For example, a gene upregulated in a small proportion of cells of a cluster will have a small log-fold change but can still be an effective marker if the focus is on specificity rather than sensitivity. 13.2.3 Finding cluster-specific markers By default, findMarkers() will give a high ranking to genes that are differentially expressed in any pairwise comparison. This is because a gene only needs a very low \\(p\\)-value in a single pairwise comparison to achieve a low Top value. A more stringent approach would onlly consider genes that are differentially expressed in all pairwise comparisons involving the cluster of interest. To achieve this, we set pval.type=&quot;all&quot; in findMarkers() to use an intersection-union test (Berger and Hsu 1996) where the combined \\(p\\)-value for each gene is the maximum of the \\(p\\)-values from all pairwise comparisons. A gene will only achieve a low combined \\(p\\)-value if it is strongly DE in all comparisons to other clusters. # We can combine this with &#39;direction=&#39;. markers.pbmc.up3 &lt;- findMarkers(sce.pbmc, sce.pbmc$cluster, pval.type=&quot;all&quot;, direction=&quot;up&quot;) interesting.up3 &lt;- markers.pbmc.up3[[chosen]] interesting.up3[1:10,1:2] ## DataFrame with 10 rows and 2 columns ## p.value FDR ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## PF4 2.34879795065091e-22 5.66230009049235e-18 ## SDPR 3.36101388406978e-22 5.66230009049235e-18 ## PPBP 3.16227660383994e-21 3.55165826299277e-17 ## NRGN 9.06202510752383e-21 7.63339684932272e-17 ## GNG11 4.9135435425841e-19 3.31113872247657e-15 ## TUBB1 1.86309735872827e-18 9.621158519226e-15 ## HIST1H2AC 1.99881609884793e-18 9.621158519226e-15 ## TAGLN2 6.60247146921232e-16 2.7807959210455e-12 ## CLU 1.19954932680453e-12 4.49084611303911e-09 ## MAP3K7CL 2.59822363085478e-11 8.7544547018021e-08 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 2.34879795065091e-22 ## 3.36101388406978e-22 ## 3.16227660383994e-21 ## 9.06202510752383e-21 ## 4.9135435425841e-19 ## 1.86309735872827e-18 ## 1.99881609884793e-18 ## 6.60247146921232e-16 ## 1.19954932680453e-12 ## 2.59822363085478e-11 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 5.66230009049235e-18 ## 5.66230009049235e-18 ## 3.55165826299277e-17 ## 7.63339684932272e-17 ## 3.31113872247657e-15 ## 9.621158519226e-15 ## 9.621158519226e-15 ## 2.7807959210455e-12 ## 4.49084611303911e-09 ## 8.7544547018021e-08 This strategy will only report genes that are highly specific to the cluster of interest. When it works, it can be highly effective as it generates a small focused set of candidate markers. However, any gene that is expressed at the same level in two or more clusters will simply not be detected. This is likely to discard many interesting genes, especially if the clusters are finely resolved with weak separation. To give a concrete example, consider a mixed population of CD4+-only, CD8+-only, double-positive and double-negative T cells. With pval.type=&quot;all&quot;, neither Cd4 or Cd8 would be detected as subpopulation-specific markers because each gene is expressed in two subpopulations. In comparison, pval.type=&quot;any&quot; will detect both of these genes as they will be DE between at least one pair of subpopulations. This reliability motivates the use of the latter setting as the default in findMarkers(). 13.3 Alternative testing regimes 13.3.1 Using the Wilcoxon rank sum test The Wilcoxon rank sum test (also known as the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, or WMW test) is another widely used method for pairwise comparisons between groups of observations. Its strength lies in the fact that it directly assesses separation between the expression distributions of different clusters. The WMW test statistic is proportional to the area-under-the-curve (AUC), i.e., the concordance probability, which is the probability of a random cell from one cluster having higher expression than a random cell from another cluster. In a pairwise comparison, AUCs of 1 or 0 indicate that the two clusters have perfectly separated expression distributions. Thus, the WMW test directly addresses the most desirable property of a candidate marker gene, while the \\(t\\) test only does so indirectly via the difference in the means and the intra-group variance. We perform WMW tests using the overlapExprs() function. This returns a list of DataFrames containing ranked candidate markers for each cluster. The direction=, lfc= and pval.type= arguments can be specified and have the same interpretation as described for \\(t\\) tests. We demonstrate below by detecting upregulated genes in each cluster with direction=&quot;up&quot;. markers.pbmc.wmw &lt;- findMarkers(sce.pbmc, test=&quot;wilcox&quot;, sce.pbmc$cluster, direction=&quot;up&quot;) names(markers.pbmc.wmw) ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;8&quot; &quot;9&quot; &quot;10&quot; &quot;11&quot; &quot;12&quot; &quot;13&quot; &quot;14&quot; To explore the results in more detail, we focus on the DataFrame for cluster 13.

A value greater than 0.5 indicates that the gene is upregulated in the current cluster compared to the other cluster, while values less than 0.5 correspond to downregulation. We would typically expect AUCs of 0.7-0.8 for a strongly upregulated candidate marker. best.set &lt;- interesting.wmw[interesting.wmw$Top &lt;= 5,] AUCs &lt;- as.matrix(best.set[,-(1:3)]) colnames(AUCs) &lt;- sub(&quot;AUC.&quot;, &quot;&quot;, colnames(AUCs)) library(pheatmap) pheatmap(AUCs, breaks=seq(0, 1, length.out=21), color=viridis::viridis(21)) Figure 13.3: Heatmap of AUCs for cluster r chosen over all other clusters. The main disadvantage of the WMW test is that the AUCs are much slower to compute compared to \\(t\\)-statistics. This may be inconvenient for interactive analyses involving multiple iterations of marker detection. We can mitigate this to some extent by parallelizing these calculations using the BPPARAM= argument in overlapExprs(). 13.3.2 Using a binomial test The binomial test identifies genes that differ in the proportion of expressing cells between clusters. (For the purposes of this section, a cell is considered to express a gene simply if it has non-zero expression for that gene.) This represents a much more stringent definition of marker genes compared to the other methods, as differences in expression between clusters are effectively ignored if both distributions of expression values are not near zero. The premise is that genes are more likely to contribute to important biological decisions if they were active in one cluster and silent in another, compared to more subtle “tuning” effects from changing the expression of an active gene. From a practical perspective, a binary measure of presence/absence is easier to validate. We perform pairwise binomial tests between clusters using the pairwiseBinom() function. This returns a list of DataFrames containing marker statistics for each cluster, such as the Top rank and its \\(p\\)-value. Here, the effect size is reported as the log-fold change in this proportion between each pair of clusters. Large positive log-fold changes indicate that the gene is more frequently expressed in one cluster compared to the other. Here, we focus on genes that are upregulated in each cluster compared to the others by setting direction=&quot;up&quot;. markers.pbmc.binom &lt;- findMarkers(sce.pbmc, test=&quot;binom&quot;, sce.pbmc$cluster, direction=&quot;up&quot;) names(markers.pbmc.binom) ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;8&quot; &quot;9&quot; &quot;10&quot; &quot;11&quot; &quot;12&quot; &quot;13&quot; &quot;14&quot; interesting.binom &lt;- markers.pbmc.binom[[chosen]] colnames(interesting.binom) ## [1] &quot;Top&quot; &quot;p.value&quot; &quot;FDR&quot; &quot;logFC.1&quot; &quot;logFC.2&quot; &quot;logFC.3&quot; ## [7] &quot;logFC.4&quot; &quot;logFC.5&quot; &quot;logFC.6&quot; &quot;logFC.7&quot; &quot;logFC.8&quot; &quot;logFC.9&quot; ## [13] &quot;logFC.10&quot; &quot;logFC.11&quot; &quot;logFC.12&quot; &quot;logFC.14&quot; Figure (fig:viol-de-binom) confirms that the top genes exhibit strong differences in the proportion of expressing cells in cluster 13 compared to the others. library(scater) top.genes &lt;- head(rownames(interesting.binom)) plotExpression(sce.pbmc, x=&quot;cluster&quot;, features=top.genes) Figure 13.4: Distribution of log-normalized expression values for the top 10 DE genes involving cluster 13 with the binomial test, stratified by cluster assignment and coloured by the plate of origin for each cell. The disadvantage of the binomial test is that its increased stringency can lead to the loss of good candidate markers. For example, GCG is a known marker for pancreatic alpha cells but is expressed in almost every other cell of the Lawlor et al. (2017) pancreas data (Figure 13.5) and would not be highly ranked by the binomial test.

Another property of the binomial test is that it will not respond to scaling normalization. Systematic differences in library size between clusters will not be considered when computing \\(p\\)-values or effect sizes. This is not necessarily problematic for marker gene detection - users can treat this as retaining information about the total RNA content, analogous to spike-in normalization. 13.3.3 Using custom DE methods It is possible to perform marker gene detection based on precomputed DE statistics. This allows us to take advantage of more sophisticated tests in dedicated DE analysis packages. To demonstrate, consider the voom() approach from the limma package (Law et al. 2014). We first process our SingleCellExperiment to obtain a fit object as shown below. library(limma) design &lt;- model.matrix(~0 + cluster, data=colData(sce.pbmc)) colnames(design) ## [1] &quot;cluster1&quot; &quot;cluster2&quot; &quot;cluster3&quot; &quot;cluster4&quot; &quot;cluster5&quot; ## [6] &quot;cluster6&quot; &quot;cluster7&quot; &quot;cluster8&quot; &quot;cluster9&quot; &quot;cluster10&quot; ## [11] &quot;cluster11&quot; &quot;cluster12&quot; &quot;cluster13&quot; &quot;cluster14&quot; # Removing very low-abundance genes. keep &lt;- calculateAverage(sce.pbmc) &gt; 0.1 summary(keep) ## Mode FALSE TRUE ## logical 29480 4214 y &lt;- convertTo(sce.pbmc, subset.row=keep) v &lt;- voom(y, design) fit &lt;- lmFit(v, design) We then perform pairwise comparisons between clusters using the TREAT strategy (McCarthy and Smyth 2009) to test for log-fold changes that are significantly greater than 0.5. For each comparison, we store the corresponding data frame of statistics in all.results, along with the identities of the clusters involved in all.pairs. nclust &lt;- length(unique(sce.pbmc$cluster)) all.results &lt;- all.pairs &lt;- list() counter &lt;- 1L # Iterating across the first &#39;nclust&#39; coefficients in design, # and comparing them to each other in a pairwise manner. for (x in seq_len(nclust)) { for (y in seq_len(x-1L)) { con &lt;- integer(ncol(design)) con[x] &lt;- 1 con[y] &lt;- -1 fit2 &lt;- contrasts.fit(fit, con) fit2 &lt;- treat(fit2, robust=TRUE, lfc=0.5) res &lt;- topTreat(fit2, n=Inf, sort.by=&quot;none&quot;) all.results[[counter]] &lt;- res all.pairs[[counter]] &lt;- colnames(design)[c(x, y)] counter &lt;- counter+1L # Also filling the reverse comparison. res$logFC &lt;- -res$logFC all.results[[counter]] &lt;- res all.pairs[[counter]] &lt;- colnames(design)[c(y, x)] counter &lt;- counter+1L } } These custom results are consolidated into a single marker list for each cluster with the combineMarkers() function. This combines test statistics across all pairwise comparisons involving a single cluster, yielding a per-cluster DataFrame that can be interpreted in the same manner as discussed previously. all.pairs &lt;- do.call(rbind, all.pairs) combined &lt;- combineMarkers(all.results, all.pairs, pval.field=&quot;P.Value&quot;) # Inspecting results for our cluster of interest again. interesting.voom &lt;- combined[[paste0(&quot;cluster&quot;, chosen)]] colnames(interesting.voom) ## [1] &quot;Top&quot; &quot;p.value&quot; &quot;FDR&quot; ## [4] &quot;logFC.cluster1&quot; &quot;logFC.cluster2&quot; &quot;logFC.cluster3&quot; ## [7] &quot;logFC.cluster4&quot; &quot;logFC.cluster5&quot; &quot;logFC.cluster6&quot; ## [10] &quot;logFC.cluster7&quot; &quot;logFC.cluster8&quot; &quot;logFC.cluster9&quot; ## [13] &quot;logFC.cluster10&quot; &quot;logFC.cluster11&quot; &quot;logFC.cluster12&quot; ## [16] &quot;logFC.cluster14&quot; head(interesting.voom[,1:3]) ## DataFrame with 6 rows and 3 columns ## Top p.value FDR ## &lt;integer&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## RGS18 1 0 0 ## C2orf88 1 0 0 ## SDPR 1 0 0 ## PPBP 1 0 0 ## SLC40A1 2 0 0 ## GP9 2 0 0 ## &lt;integer&gt; ## 1 ## 1 ## 1 ## 1 ## 2 ## 2 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 By default, we do not use custom DE methods to perform marker detection, for several reasons. Many of these methods rely on empirical Bayes shrinkage to share information across genes in the presence of limited replication. However, this is unnecessary when one treats the many cells in a group as “replicates” of each other (see Section ???). These methods also make stronger assumptions about the data (e.g., equal variances for linear models, the distribution of variances during empirical Bayes) that are more likely to be violated in noisy scRNA-seq contexts. From a practical perspective, they require more work to set up and take more time to run. Nonetheless, some custom methods (e.g., MAST) may provide a useful point of difference from the simpler tests, in which case they can be converted into a marker detection scheme as described above. 13.4 Handling blocking factors 13.5 Using the block= argument Large studies may contain factors of variation that are known and not interesting (e.g., batch effects, sex differences). If these are not modelled, they can interfere with marker gene detection - most obviously by inflating the variance within each cluster, but also by distorting the log-fold changes if the cluster composition varies across levels of the blocking factor. To avoid these issues, we set the block= argument in the findMarkers() call, as demonstrated below for the 416B data set.

The function will then combine \\(p\\)-values from different plates using Stouffer’s Z method to obtain a single \\(p\\)-value per pairwise comparison. (These \\(p\\)-values are further combined across comparisons to obtain a single \\(p\\)-value per gene, using either Simes’ method or an intersection-union test depending on the value of pval.type=.)

In scenarios where cells from two clusters never co-occur in the same batch, the comparison will be impossible and NAs will be reported in the output. 13.6 Using the design= argument Another approach is to define a design matrix containing the batch of origin as the sole factor. findMarkers() will then fit a linear model to the log-expression values, similar to the use of limma for bulk RNA sequencing data (Ritchie et al. 2015). This handles situations where multiple batches contain unique clusters, as comparisons can be implicitly performed via shared cell types in each batch. There is also a slight increase in power when information is shared across clusters for variance estimation. # Setting up the design matrix (we remove intercept for full rank # in the final design matrix with the cluster-specific terms). design &lt;- model.matrix(~sce.416b$block) design &lt;- design[,-1,drop=FALSE] m.alt &lt;- findMarkers(sce.416b, sce.416b$cluster, design=design, direction=&quot;up&quot;) demo &lt;- m.alt[[&quot;1&quot;]] demo[demo$Top &lt;= 5,1:3] ## DataFrame with 10 rows and 3 columns ## Top p.value FDR ## &lt;integer&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## Myh11 1 1.45764407192239e-37 6.79320443278709e-33 ## Cd63-ps 1 6.00969077470487e-14 3.45772381314007e-11 ## Tmsb4x 2 7.44718647789748e-33 1.73534339307966e-28 ## Cd63 2 4.57134696124305e-15 3.43617828680276e-12 ## Ctsd 3 5.72704193331962e-32 8.89676874201425e-28 ## Cd200r3 3 1.62452998456133e-31 1.89273988501241e-27 ## Itga6 4 7.65834202601782e-30 5.94848952967556e-26 ## Gm6977 4 2.24061125327439e-15 1.76985503131524e-12 ## CBFB-MYH11-mcherry 5 2.15310414289334e-30 2.00686530950803e-26 ## Ccnd2 5 1.60701169628252e-10 5.34951236382506e-08 ## &lt;integer&gt; ## 1 ## 1 ## 2 ## 2 ## 3 ## 3 ## 4 ## 4 ## 5 ## 5 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 1.45764407192239e-37 ## 6.00969077470487e-14 ## 7.44718647789748e-33 ## 4.57134696124305e-15 ## 5.72704193331962e-32 ## 1.62452998456133e-31 ## 7.65834202601782e-30 ## 2.24061125327439e-15 ## 2.15310414289334e-30 ## 1.60701169628252e-10 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 6.79320443278709e-33 ## 3.45772381314007e-11 ## 1.73534339307966e-28 ## 3.43617828680276e-12 ## 8.89676874201425e-28 ## 1.89273988501241e-27 ## 5.94848952967556e-26 ## 1.76985503131524e-12 ## 2.00686530950803e-26 ## 5.34951236382506e-08 The use of a linear model makes some strong assumptions, necessitating some caution when interpreting the results. If the batch effect is not consistent across clusters, the variance will be inflated and the log-fold change estimates will be distorted. Variances are also assumed to be equal across groups, which is not true in general. In particular, the presence of clusters in which a gene is silent will shrink the residual variance towards zero, preventing the model from penalizing genes with high variance in other clusters. Thus, we generally recommend the use of block= where possible. 13.7 Invalidity of \\(p\\)-values 13.7.1 From data snooping All of our DE strategies for detecting marker genes between clusters are statistically flawed to some extent. The DE analysis is performed on the same data used to obtain the clusters, which represents “data dredging” (also known as fishing or data snooping). The hypothesis of interest - that are there differences between clusters? - is formulated from the data, so we are more likely to get a positive result when we re-use the data set to test that hypothesis. The practical effect of data dredging is best illustrated with a simple simulation. We simulate i.i.d. normal values, perform \\(k\\)-means clustering and test for DE between clusters of cells with findMarkers(). The resulting distribution of \\(p\\)-values is heavily skewed towards low values (Figure 13.6). Thus, we can detect “significant” differences between clusters even in the absence of any real substructure in the data. This effect arises from the fact that clustering, by definition, yields groups of cells that are separated in expression space. Testing for DE genes between clusters will inevitably yield some significant results as that is how the clusters were defined. library(scran) set.seed(0) y &lt;- matrix(rnorm(100000), ncol=200) clusters &lt;- kmeans(t(y), centers=2)$cluster out &lt;- findMarkers(y, clusters) hist(out[[1]]$p.value, col=&quot;grey80&quot;, xlab=&quot;p-value&quot;) Figure 13.6: Distribution of \\(p\\)-values from a DE analysis between two clusters in a simulation with no true subpopulation structure. For marker gene detection, this effect is largely harmless as the \\(p\\)-values are used only for ranking. However, it becomes an issue when the \\(p\\)-values are used to define “significant differences” between clusters with respect to an error rate threshold. Meaningful interpretation of error rates require consideration of the long-run behaviour, i.e., the rate of incorrect rejections if the experiment were repeated many times. The concept of statistical significance for differences between clusters is not applicable if clusters and their interpretations are not stably reproducible across (hypothetical) replicate experiments. 13.7.2 Nature of replication The naive application of DE analysis methods will treat counts from the same cluster of cells as replicate observations. This is not the most relevant level of replication when cells are derived from the same biological sample (i.e., cell culture, animal or patient). DE analyses that treat cells as replicates fail to properly model the sample-to-sample variability (A. T. L. Lun and Marioni 2017). The latter is arguably the more important level of replication as different samples will necessarily be generated if the experiment is to be replicated. Indeed, the use of cells as replicates only masks the fact that the sample size is actually one in an experiment involving a single biological sample. This reinforces the inappropriateness of using the marker gene \\(p\\)-values to make statements about statistical inference.

They typically arise due to errors in cell sorting or capture, especially in droplet-based protocols (Zheng et al. 2017) involving thousands of cells. Doublets are obviously undesirable when the aim is to characterize populations at the single-cell level. In particular, doublets can be mistaken for intermediate populations or transitory states that do not actually exist. Thus, it is desirable to identify and remove doublet libraries so that they do not compromise interpretation of the results. Several experimental strategies are available for doublet removal. One approach exploits natural genetic variation when pooling cells from multiple donor individuals (Kang et al. 2018). Doublets can be identified as libraries with allele combinations that do not exist in any single donor. Another approach is to mark a subset of cells (e.g., all cells from one sample) with an antibody conjugated to a different oligonucleotide (Stoeckius et al. 2017). Upon pooling, libraries that are observed to have different oligonucleotides are considered to be doublets and removed. These approaches can be highly effective but rely on experimental information that may not be available. A more general approach is to infer doublets from the expression profiles alone (Dahlin et al. 2018). In this workflow, we will describe two purely computational approaches for detecting doublets from scRNA-seq data. The main difference between these two methods is whether or not they need cluster information beforehand. We will demonstrate the use of these methods on 10X Genomics data from a droplet-based scRNA-seq study of the mouse mammary gland (Bach et al. 2017).

Specifically, it will examine every possible triplet of clusters consisting of a query cluster and its two “parents”. It will then compute a number of statistics: The number of genes (N) that are differentially expressed in the same direction in the query cluster compared to both of the parent clusters. Such genes would be unique markers for the query cluster and provide evidence against the null hypothesis, i.e., that the query cluster consists of doublets from the two parents. Clusters with few unique genes are more likely to be composed of doublets. The ratio of the median library size in each parent to the median library size in the query (lib.size fields). Doublet libraries are generated from a larger initial pool of RNA compared to libraries for single cells, and thus the former should have larger library sizes. Library size ratios much greater than unity are inconsistent with a doublet identity for the query. The proportion of cells in the query cluster should also be reasonable - typically less than 5% of all cells, depending on how many cells were loaded onto the 10X Genomics device. For each query cluster, the best pair of parents is identified based solely on the lowest N. (This means that any lib.size* above unity is not definitive evidence against a doublet identity for a query cluster, as there may be a pair of parents with slightly higher N but both lib.size* values below unity.)

Clusters are then ranked by N in the output of doubletClusters(), allowing us to prioritize “high-risk” clusters that require careful investigation.

Column colours represent the cluster to which each cell is assigned, as indicated by the legend. Closer examination of some known markers suggests that the offending cluster consists of doublets of basal cells (Acta2) and alveolar cells (Csn2) (Figure 14.2). Indeed, no cell type is known to strongly express both of these genes at the same time, which supports the hypothesis that this cluster consists solely of doublets19. plotExpression(sce.mam, features=c(&quot;Acta2&quot;, &quot;Csn2&quot;), x=&quot;cluster&quot;, colour_by=&quot;cluster&quot;) Figure 14.2: Distribution of log-normalized expression values for Acta2 and Csn2 in each cluster. Each point represents a cell. The strength of doubletCluster() lies in its simplicity and ease of interpretation. Suspect clusters can be quickly flagged based on the metrics returned by the function. However, it is obviously dependent on the quality of the clustering. Clusters that are too coarse will fail to separate doublets from other cells, while clusters that are too fine will complicate interpretation. The method is also somewhat biased towards clusters with fewer cells, where the reduction in power is more likely to result in a low N. (Fortunately, this is a desirable effect as doublets should be rare in a properly performed scRNA-seq experiment.) 14.3 Doublet detection by simulation 14.3.1 Overview The other doublet detection strategy involves in silico simulation of doublets from the single-cell expression profiles (Dahlin et al. 2018). This is performed using the doubletCells() function from scran, which will: Simulate thousands of doublets by adding together two randomly chosen single-cell profiles. For each original cell, compute the density of simulated doublets in the surrounding neighbourhood. For each original cell, compute the density of other observed cells in the neighbourhood. Return the ratio between the two densities as a “doublet score” for each cell. This approach assumes that the simulated doublets are good approximations for real doublets. The use of random selection accounts for the relative abundances of different subpopulations, which affect the likelihood of their involvement in doublets; and the calculation of a ratio avoids high scores for non-doublet cells in highly abundant subpopulations. 14.3.2 Application to the mammary data We see the function in action below. To speed up the density calculations, doubletCells() will perform a PCA on the log-expression matrix. When BSPARAM=IrlbaParam(), methods from the irlba package are used to perform a fast approximate PCA - hence the use of set.seed() to ensure that results are reproducible. library(BiocSingular) set.seed(100) # Setting up the parameters for consistency with denoisePCA(); # this can be changed depending on your feature selection scheme. dbl.dens &lt;- doubletCells(sce.mam, BSPARAM=IrlbaParam(), subset.row=dec.mam$bio &gt; 0, d=ncol(reducedDim(sce.mam))) summary(dbl.dens) ## Min. 1st Qu.

Each point is a cell coloured according to its doublet density. From the clustering information, we see that the affected cells belong to the same cluster that was identified using doubletCluster() (Figure 14.4)20. plotColData(sce.mam, x=&quot;cluster&quot;, y=&quot;DoubletScore&quot;, colour_by=&quot;cluster&quot;) Figure 14.4: Distribution of doublet scores for each cluster in the mammary gland data set. Each point is a cell. 14.4 Strengths and weaknesses The advantage of doubletCells() is that it does not depend on clusters, reducing the sensitivity of the results to clustering quality. The downside is that it requires some strong assumptions about how doublets form, such as the combining proportions and the sampling from pure subpopulations. In particular, doubletCells() treats the library size of each cell as an accurate proxy for its total RNA content. If this is not true, the simulation will not combine expression profiles from different cells in the correct proportions. This means that the simulated doublets will be systematically shifted away from the real doublets, resulting in doublet scores that are too low. Simply removing cells with high doublet scores will not be sufficient to eliminate real doublets from the data set. In some cases, only a subset of the cells in the putative doublet cluster actually have high scores. Removing these would still leave enough cells in that cluster to mislead downstream analyses. In fact, even defining a threshold on the doublet score is difficult as the interpretation of the score is relative. There is no general definition for a fixed threshold above which libraries are to be considered doublets. We recommend interpreting the doubletCells() scores in the context of cluster annotation. All cells from a cluster with a large average doublet score should be considered suspect, and close neighbours of problematic clusters should also be treated with caution. In contrast, a cluster containing a small proportion of high-scoring cells is probably safe provided that any interesting results ae not being driven by those cells (e.g., checking that DE in an interesting gene is not driven solely by cells with high doublet scores). While clustering is still required, this approach is more robust than doubletClusters() to the quality of the clustering as the scores are computed on a per-cell basis. (As an aside, the issue of unknown combining proportions can be solved completely if spike-in information is available, e.g., in plate-based protocols. This will provide an accurate estimate of the total RNA content of each cell. To this end, spike-in-based size factors from Section ??? can be supplied to the doubletCells() function via the size.factors.content= argument. This will use the spike-in size factors to scale the contribution of each cell to a doublet library.) 14.5 Further comments Doublet detection procedures should only be applied to libraries generated in the same experimental batch. It is obviously impossible for doublets to form between two cells that were captured separately. Thus, some understanding of the experimental design is required prior to the use of the above functions. This avoids unnecessary concerns about the validity of batch-specific clusters that cannot possibly consist of doublets. It is also difficult to interpret doublet predictions in data containing cellular trajectories. By definition, cells in the middle of a trajectory are always intermediate between other cells and are liable to be incorrectly detected as doublets. Some protection is provided by the non-linear nature of many real trajectories, which reduces the risk of simulated doublets coinciding with real cells in doubletCells(). One can also put more weight on the relative library sizes in doubletCluster() instead of relying solely on N, under the assumption that sudden spikes in RNA content are unlikely in a continuous biological process. The best solution to the doublet problem is experimental - that is, to avoid generating them in the first place21. This should be a consideration when designing scRNA-seq experiments, where the desire to obtain large numbers of cells at minimum cost should be weighed against the general deterioration in data quality and reliability when doublets become more frequent. If cell labelling information is available (Kang et al. 2018; Stoeckius et al. 2018), we recommend using it to mark doublet cells for use in identification of problematic clusters or cellular states in downstream analyses. Direct removal fails to account for unlabelled intra-sample doublets that can still be present in sufficient numbers to drive misleading conclusions, while the marking approach uses “guilt by association” to identify neighboring unlabelled doublets.

However, the processing of different batches is often subject to uncontrollable differences, e.g., changes in operator, differences in reagent quality. This results in systematic differences in the observed expression in cells from different batches, which we refer to as “batch effects”. Batch effects are problematic as they can be major drivers of heterogeneity in the data, masking the relevant biological differences and complicating interpretation of the results. Computational correction of these effects is critical for eliminating batch-to-batch variation, allowing data across multiple batches to be combined for common downstream analysis. However, existing methods based on linear models (Ritchie et al. 2015; Leek et al. 2012) assume that the composition of cell populations are either known or the same across batches. To overcome these limitations, bespoke methods have been developed for batch correction of single-cell data (Haghverdi et al. 2018; Butler et al. 2018; Lin et al. 2019) that do not require a priori knowledge about the composition of the population. This allows them to be used in workflows for exploratory analyses of scRNA-seq data where such knowledge is usually unavailable. 15.2 Setting up the data To demonstrate, we will use two separate 10X Genomics PBMC datasets generated in two different batches. Each dataset was obtained from the TENxPBMCData package and separately subjected to basic processing steps. Separate processing prior to the batch correction step is more convenient, scalable and (on occasion) more reliable. For example, outlier-based QC on the cells is more effective when performed within a batch (Chapter ???). The same can also be said for trend fitting when modelling the mean-variance relationship (Section ???).

We use the average as it is responsive to batch-specific HVGs while still preserving the within-batch ranking of genes. This allows us to use the same strategies described in Chapter ??? to select genes of interest. For example, if we were to retain all genes with positive biological components, convergence of the average towards zero for non-HVGs ensures that the expected number of retained genes is stable with more batches. In contrast, approaches based on taking the intersection or union of HVGs across batches become increasingly conservative or liberal, respectively, with an increasing number of batches. library(scran) combined.dec &lt;- combineVar(dec3k[universe,], dec4k[universe,]) chosen.hvgs &lt;- combined.dec$bio &gt; 0 combined.dec[,1:6] ## DataFrame with 31232 rows and 6 columns ## mean total ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## ENSG00000243485 0 0 ## ENSG00000237613 0 0 ## ENSG00000186092 0 0 ## ENSG00000238009 0.00104386992482179 0.00106138029098745 ## ENSG00000239945 0.000258798374840956 0.000281948894897105 ## ... ... ... ## ENSG00000212907 0.535233858583492 0.437804768744041 ## ENSG00000198886 3.01692549039158 0.617031726421764 ## ENSG00000198786 1.54198723959989 0.617834240701208 ## ENSG00000198695 0.127831201202011 0.129776187258376 ## ENSG00000198727 2.56240219438806 0.717304616025944 ## tech bio ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## ENSG00000243485 0 0 ## ENSG00000237613 0 0 ## ENSG00000186092 0 0 ## ENSG00000238009 0.00106590149862648 -4.5212076390281e-06 ## ENSG00000239945 0.000264260487890133 1.7688407006972e-05 ## ... ... ... ## ENSG00000212907 0.408040682015157 0.0297640867288842 ## ENSG00000198886 0.596769334163596 0.0202623922581677 ## ENSG00000198786 0.628483569105677 -0.0106493284044691 ## ENSG00000198695 0.129278188915683 0.000497998342692874 ## ENSG00000198727 0.691490878290747 0.025813737735197 ## p.value FDR ## &lt;numeric&gt; &lt;numeric&gt; ## ENSG00000243485 NA NA ## ENSG00000237613 NA NA ## ENSG00000186092 NA NA ## ENSG00000238009 0.512246219727119 0.834032704052722 ## ENSG00000239945 0.314021257793438 0.834032704052722 ## ... ... ... ## ENSG00000212907 0.40460723763713 0.834032704052722 ## ENSG00000198886 0.215888744541045 0.834032704052722 ## ENSG00000198786 0.642327056158103 0.834072154688035 ## ENSG00000198695 0.585074623235346 0.834032704052722 ## ENSG00000198727 0.419767773986605 0.834032704052722 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0.00104386992482179 ## 0.000258798374840956 ## ... ## 0.535233858583492 ## 3.01692549039158 ## 1.54198723959989 ## 0.127831201202011 ## 2.56240219438806 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0.00106138029098745 ## 0.000281948894897105 ## ... ## 0.437804768744041 ## 0.617031726421764 ## 0.617834240701208 ## 0.129776187258376 ## 0.717304616025944 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## 0.00106590149862648 ## 0.000264260487890133 ## ... ## 0.408040682015157 ## 0.596769334163596 ## 0.628483569105677 ## 0.129278188915683 ## 0.691490878290747 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## 0 ## 0 ## 0 ## -4.5212076390281e-06 ## 1.7688407006972e-05 ## ... ## 0.0297640867288842 ## 0.0202623922581677 ## -0.0106493284044691 ## 0.000497998342692874 ## 0.025813737735197 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## NA ## NA ## NA ## 0.512246219727119 ## 0.314021257793438 ## ... ## 0.40460723763713 ## 0.215888744541045 ## 0.642327056158103 ## 0.585074623235346 ## 0.419767773986605 ## &lt;numeric&gt; ## NA ## NA ## NA ## 0.834032704052722 ## 0.834032704052722 ## ... ## 0.834032704052722 ## 0.834032704052722 ## 0.834072154688035 ## 0.834032704052722 ## 0.834032704052722 15.3 Diagnosing batch effects Before we actually perform any correction, it is worth examining whether there is any batch effect in this dataset.

As our two PBMC populations should be replicates, each cluster should ideally consist of cells from both batches. However, we instead see clusters that are comprised of cells from a single batch. This indicates that cells of the same type are artificially separated due to technical differences between batches. library(scran) snn.gr &lt;- buildSNNGraph(combined, use.dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;) clusters &lt;- igraph::cluster_walktrap(snn.gr)$membership tab &lt;- table(Cluster=clusters, Batch=combined$batch) tab ## Batch ## Cluster 3k 4k ## 1 0 126 ## 2 12 459 ## 3 1 776 ## 4 0 1310 ## 5 500 0 ## 6 0 536 ## 7 0 606 ## 8 1296 0 ## 9 0 176 ## 10 0 54 ## 11 149 0 ## 12 30 1 ## 13 0 89 ## 14 131 0 ## 15 342 0 ## 16 1 10 ## 17 134 0 ## 18 11 3 ## 19 2 36 We can also visualize the corrected coordinates using a \\(t\\)-SNE plot (Figure 15.1).

Each point is a cell that is colored according to its batch of origin. Of course, the other explanation for batch-specific clusters is that there are cell types that are unique to each batch. The degree of intermingling of cells from different batches is not an effective diagnostic when the batches involved might actually contain unique cell subpopulations (which is not a consideration in the PBMC dataset, but the same cannot be said in general). If a cluster only contains cells from a single batch, one can always debate whether that is caused by a failure of the correction method or if there is truly a batch-specific subpopulation. For example, do batch-specific metabolic or differentiation states represent distinct subpopulations? Or should they be merged together? We will not attempt to answer this here, only noting that each batch correction algorithm will make different (and possibly inappropriate) decisions on what constitutes “shared” and “unique” populations. 15.4 Linear regression Batch effects in bulk RNA sequencing studies are commonly removed with linear regression. This involves fitting a linear model to each gene’s expression profile, setting the undesirable batch term to zero and recomputing the observations sans the batch effect, yielding a set of corrected expression values for downstream analyses. Linear modelling is the basis of the removeBatchEffect() function from the limma package (Ritchie et al. 2015) as well the comBat() function from the sva package (Leek et al. 2012). To use this approach in a scRNA-seq context, we assume that the composition of cell subpopulations is the same across batches. We also assume that the batch effect is additive, i.e., any batch-induced fold-change in expression is the same across different cell subpopulations for any given gene. These are strong assumptions as batches derived from different individuals will naturally exhibit variation in cell type abundances and expression. Nonetheless, they may be acceptable when dealing with batches that are technical replicates generated from the same population of cells. Linear modelling can also accommodate situations where the composition is known a priori by including the cell type as a factor in the linear model, but this situation is even less common23. We use the rescaleBatches() function from the batchelor package to remove the batch effect. This is roughly equivalent to applying a linear regression to the log-expression values per gene, with some adjustments to improve performance and efficiency. For each gene, the mean expression in each batch is scaled down until it is equal to the lowest mean across all batches. We deliberately choose to scale all expression values down as this mitigates differences in variance when batches lie at different positions on the mean-variance trend. (Specifically, the shrinkage effect of the pseudo-count is greater for smaller counts, suppressing any differences in variance across batches.) An additional feature of rescaleBatches() is that it will preserve sparsity in the input matrix for greater efficiency, whereas other methods like removeBatchEffect() will always return a dense matrix. library(batchelor) rescaled &lt;- rescaleBatches(pbmc3k, pbmc4k) rescaled ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 31232 6791 ## metadata(0): ## assays(1): corrected ## rownames(31232): ENSG00000243485 ENSG00000237613 ... ## ENSG00000198695 ENSG00000198727 ## rowData names(0): ## colnames: NULL ## colData names(1): batch ## reducedDimNames(0): ## spikeNames(0): ## altExpNames(0): After clustering, we observe that most clusters consist of mixtures of cells from the two replicate batches, consistent with the removal of the batch effect. This conclusion is supported by the apparent mixing of cells from different batches in Figure 15.2. However, at least one batch-specific cluster is still present, indicating that the correction is not entirely complete. This is attributable to violation of one of the aforementioned assumptions, even in this simple case involving replicated batches. set.seed(1010101010) rescaled &lt;- runPCA(rescaled, subset_row=chosen.hvgs, BSPARAM=BiocSingular::IrlbaParam(), exprs_values=&quot;corrected&quot;) snn.gr &lt;- buildSNNGraph(rescaled, use.dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;) clusters.resc &lt;- igraph::cluster_walktrap(snn.gr)$membership tab.resc &lt;- table(Cluster=clusters.resc, Batch=rescaled$batch) tab.resc ## Batch ## Cluster 1 2 ## 1 272 523 ## 2 336 606 ## 3 126 266 ## 4 643 560 ## 5 19 47 ## 6 12 3 ## 7 313 0 ## 8 8 50 ## 9 19 58 ## 10 15 70 ## 11 131 154 ## 12 37 511 ## 13 10 83 ## 14 100 207 ## 15 137 8 ## 16 16 25 ## 17 397 964 ## 18 3 36 ## 19 4 8 ## 20 11 3 rescaled &lt;- runTSNE(rescaled, dimred=&quot;PCA&quot;) rescaled$batch &lt;- factor(rescaled$batch) plotTSNE(rescaled, colour_by=&quot;batch&quot;) Figure 15.2: \\(t\\)-SNE plot of the PBMC datasets after correction with rescaleBatches(). Each point represents a cell and is colored according to the batch of origin. 15.5 Performing MNN correction 15.5.1 Application to the PBMC data Consider a cell \\(a\\) in batch \\(A\\), and identify the cells in batch \\(B\\) that are nearest neighbours to \\(a\\) in the expression space defined by the selected features. Repeat this for a cell \\(b\\) in batch \\(B\\), identifying its nearest neighbours in \\(A\\). Mutual nearest neighbours are pairs of cells from different batches that belong in each other’s set of nearest neighbours. The reasoning is that MNN pairs represent cells from the same biological state prior to the application of a batch effect - see Haghverdi et al. (2018) for full theoretical details. Thus, the difference between cells in MNN pairs can be used as an estimate of the batch effect, the subtraction of which yields batch-corrected values. The batchelor package provides an implementation of the MNN approach via the fastMNN() function. (Unlike the MNN method described by Haghverdi et al. (2018), the fastMNN() function performs PCA to reduce the dimensions beforehand and speed up the downstream neighbor detection steps.) We apply it to our two PBMC batches to remove the batch effect across the highly variable genes in chosen. To reduce computational work and technical noise, all cells in all batches are projected into the low-dimensional space defined by the top d principal components. Identification of MNNs and calculation of correction vectors are then performed in this low-dimensional space. # Using randomized SVD here, as this is faster than # irlba for file-backed matrices. set.seed(1000101001) mnn.out &lt;- fastMNN(pbmc3k, pbmc4k, d=50, k=20, BSPARAM=BiocSingular::RandomParam(deferred=TRUE)) mnn.out ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 31232 6791 ## metadata(1): merge.info ## assays(1): reconstructed ## rownames(31232): ENSG00000243485 ENSG00000237613 ... ## ENSG00000198695 ENSG00000198727 ## rowData names(1): rotation ## colnames: NULL ## colData names(1): batch ## reducedDimNames(1): corrected ## spikeNames(0): ## altExpNames(0): The function returns a SingleCellExperiment object containing corrected values for downstream analyses like clustering or visualization.

This can be interpreted as the minimum anticipated frequency of any shared cell type or state in each batch. Increasing k will generally result in more aggressive merging as the algorithm is more generous in matching subpopulations across batches. It can occasionally be desirable to increase k if one clearly sees that the same cell types are not being adequately merged across batches. 15.5.2 Correction diagnostics We cluster on the low-dimensional corrected coordinates to obtain a partitioning of the cells that serves as a proxy for the population structure. If the batch effect is successfully corrected, clusters corresponding to shared cell types or states should contain cells from multiple batches. We see that all clusters contain contributions from each batch after correction, consistent with our expectation that the two batches are replicates of each other. library(scran) snn.gr &lt;- buildSNNGraph(mnn.out, use.dimred=&quot;corrected&quot;) clusters.mnn &lt;- igraph::cluster_walktrap(snn.gr)$membership tab.mnn &lt;- table(Cluster=clusters.mnn, Batch=mnn.out$batch) tab.mnn ## Batch ## Cluster 1 2 ## 1 152 181 ## 2 331 589 ## 3 531 1205 ## 4 277 502 ## 5 283 597 ## 6 617 579 ## 7 203 181 ## 8 13 51 ## 9 17 69 ## 10 7 18 ## 11 11 16 ## 12 18 61 ## 13 131 86 ## 14 3 36 ## 15 4 8 ## 16 11 3 We can also visualize the corrected coordinates using a \\(t\\)-SNE plot (Figure 15.3).

Each point is a cell that is colored according to its batch of origin. For fastMNN(), one useful diagnostic is the proportion of variance within each batch that is lost during MNN correction. Specifically, this refers to the within-batch variance that is removed during orthogonalization with respect to the average correction vector at each merge step. This is returned via the lost.var field in the metadata of mnn.out, which contains a matrix of the variance lost in each batch (column) at each merge step (row). metadata(mnn.out)$merge.info$lost.var ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 0.004368 0.003173 Large proportions of lost variance suggest that correction is removing genuine biological heterogeneity. This would occur due to violations of the assumption of orthogonality between the batch effect and the biological subspace (Haghverdi et al. 2018). In this case, the proportion of lost variance is small, indicating that non-orthogonality is not a major concern. 15.6 Preserving biological heterogeneity Another useful diagnostic check is to compare the clustering within each batch to the clustering of the merged data. Accurate data integration should preserve variance within each batch as there should be nothing to remove between cells in the same batch. This check complements the previously mentioned diagnostics that only focus on the removal of differences between batches. Specifically, it protects us against cases where the correction method simply aggregates all cells together, which would achieve perfect mixing but also discard the biological heterogeneity of interest. Ideally, we should see a many-to-1 mapping where the across-batch clustering is nested inside the within-batch clusterings. This indicates that any within-batch structure was preserved after correction while acknowledging that greater resolution is possible with more cells. In practice, more discrepancies can be expected even when the correction is perfect, due to the existence of closely related clusters that were arbitrarily separated in the within-batch clustering. As a general rule, we can be satisfied with the correction if the vast majority of entries of the table()s below are zero, though this may depend on whether specific clusters of interest are gained or lost. # For the first batch. table(New=clusters.mnn[rescaled$batch==1], Old=pbmc3k$cluster) ## Old ## New 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ## 1 0 1 0 0 0 151 0 0 0 ## 2 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 328 0 ## 3 0 8 17 506 0 0 0 0 0 ## 4 0 273 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 ## 5 281 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 ## 6 0 46 475 96 0 0 0 0 0 ## 7 179 0 0 0 0 0 24 0 0 ## 8 9 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 ## 9 1 0 0 0 16 0 0 0 0 ## 10 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 4 0 ## 11 0 0 11 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 12 0 0 0 0 18 0 0 0 0 ## 13 1 0 0 0 0 0 130 0 0 ## 14 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 15 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 ## 16 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 11 # For the second batch. table(New=clusters.mnn[rescaled$batch==2], Old=pbmc4k$cluster) ## Old ## New 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ## 1 0 0 0 0 0 181 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 2 0 0 0 0 221 0 368 0 0 0 0 0 ## 3 20 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 997 185 0 0 ## 4 0 1 0 496 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 5 0 594 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 ## 6 458 0 0 66 0 0 0 0 39 16 0 0 ## 7 0 179 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 ## 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 45 0 0 0 0 ## 9 0 4 65 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 10 0 0 0 1 4 1 12 0 0 0 0 0 ## 11 14 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 12 0 0 61 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ## 13 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 77 0 ## 14 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 36 ## 15 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 ## 16 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 We can summarize the agreement between clusterings by computing the Rand index.

Clustering on the merged datasets yields fewer batch-specific clusters, which is recapitulated as greater intermingling between batches in Figure 15.5. This improvement over Figure 15.4 represents the ability of fastMNN() to adapt to more complex situations involving differences in population composition between batches. mnn.pancreas &lt;- fastMNN(sce.grun, sce.muraro, subset.row=chosen.genes) snn.gr &lt;- buildSNNGraph(mnn.pancreas, use.dimred=&quot;corrected&quot;) clusters &lt;- igraph::cluster_walktrap(snn.gr)$membership tab &lt;- table(Cluster=clusters, Batch=mnn.pancreas$batch) tab ## Batch ## Cluster 1 2 ## 1 320 279 ## 2 343 265 ## 3 209 847 ## 4 61 197 ## 5 161 399 ## 6 42 1 ## 7 25 108 ## 8 22 127 ## 9 59 80 ## 10 33 0 ## 11 0 18 ## 12 8 4 ## 13 7 21 mnn.pancreas &lt;- runTSNE(mnn.pancreas, dimred=&quot;corrected&quot;) plotTSNE(mnn.pancreas, colour_by=&quot;batch&quot;) Figure 15.5: \\(t\\)-SNE plot of the pancreas datasets after correction with fastMNN(). Each point represents a cell and is colored according to the batch of origin. 15.8 Using the corrected values The greatest value of batch correction lies in facilitating cell-based analysis of population heterogeneity in a consistent manner across batches. Cluster 1 in batch A is the same as cluster 1 in batch B when the clustering is performed on the merged data. There is no need to identify mappings between separate clusterings, which might not even be possible when the clusters are not well-separated. The burden of interpretation is consolidated by generating a single set of clusters for all batches, rather than requiring separate examination of each batch’s clusters. Another benefit is that the available number of cells is increased when all batches are combined, which allows for greater resolution of population structure in downstream analyses24. We previously demonstrated the application of clustering methods to the batch-corrected data, but the same principles apply for other analyses like trajectory reconstruction. At this point, it is also tempting to use the batch-corrected values for gene-based analyses like DE-based marker gene detection. This is not generally recommended as an arbitrary correction algorithm is not obliged to preserve the magnitude (or even direction) of differences in per-gene expression when attempting to align multiple batches. For example, cosine normalization in fastMNN() shrinks the magnitude of the expression values so that any subsequent log-fold change calculations are meaningless. Rather, it is preferable to perform DE analyses using the uncorrected expression values with blocking on the batch, as discussed i Chapter ???. This strategy is based on the expectation that any genuine DE between clusters should still be present in a within-batch comparison where batch effects are absent. It penalizes genes that exhibit inconsistent DE across batches, thus protecting against misleading conclusions when a population in one batch is aligned to a similar-but-not-identical population in another batch.

For example, a researcher could use this strategy to detect changes in cell type abundance after drug treatment (Richard et al. 2018) or genetic modifications (Scialdone et al. 2016). This provides more biological insight than conventional scRNA-seq experiments involving only one biological condition, especially if we can relate population changes to specific experimental perturbations. Differential analyses of multi-condition scRNA-seq experiments can be broadly split into two categies - differential expression (DE) and differential abundance (DA) analyses. The former tests for changes in expression between conditions for cells of the same type that are present in both conditions, while the latter tests for changes in the composition of cell types (or states, etc.) between conditions. In this chapter, we will demonstrate both analyses using data from a study of the early mouse embryo (Pijuan-Sala et al. 2019). 16.2 Setting up the data Our demonstration scRNA-seq dataset was generated from chimeric mouse embryos at the E8.5 developmental stage. Each chimeric embryo was generated by injecting td-Tomato-positive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into a wild-type (WT) blastocyst. Unlike in previous experiments (Scialdone et al. 2016), there is no genetic difference between the injected and background cells other than the expression of td-Tomato in the former. Instead, the aim of this “wild-type chimera” study is to determine whether the injection procedure itself introduces differences in lineage commitment compared to the background cells25. The experiment used a paired design with three replicate batches of two samples each. Specifically, each batch contains one sample consisting of td-Tomato positive cells and another consisting of negative cells, obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from a single pool of dissociated cells from 6-7 chimeric embryos. For each sample, scRNA-seq data was generated using the 10X Genomics protocol (Zheng et al. 2017) to obtain 2000-7000 cells.

For brevity, we will not explicitly repeat them here, only noting that we have already merged cells from all samples into the same coordinate system (see Section ???) and clustered the merged dataset to obtain a common partitioning across all samples.

For simplicity, we will skip this step by directly using the cell type labels provided by Pijuan-Sala et al. (2019). These were obtained by mapping the cells in this dataset to a larger, pre-annotated “atlas” of mouse early embryonic development. While broadly consistent, many of our clusters map to multiple labels (Figure @ref(fig:heat-cluster-label}), which reflects the difficulties in unambiguously resolving cell types undergoing differentiation. by.label &lt;- table(merged$cluster, merged$celltype.mapped) pheatmap::pheatmap(log2(by.label+1), cluster_cols=FALSE, cluster_rows=FALSE, color=viridis::viridis(101)) Figure 16.1: Heatmap showing the abundance of cells with each combination of cluster (row) and cell type label (column). The color scale represents the log2-count for each combination. 16.3 Differential expression between conditions 16.3.1 Creating pseudo-bulk samples The most obvious differential analysis is to look for changes in expression between conditions. We perform the DE analysis separately for each label to identify cell type-specific transcriptional effects of injection. The actual DE testing is performed on “pseudo-bulk” expression profiles (Tung et al. 2017), generated by summing counts together for all cells with the same combination of label and sample. This leverages the resolution offered by single-cell technologies to define the labels, and combines it with the statistical rigor of existing methods for DE analyses involving a small number of samples. # Using &#39;label&#39; and &#39;sample&#39; as our two factors; each column of the output # corresponds to one unique combination of these two factors. summed &lt;- aggregateAcrossCells(merged, id=DataFrame( label=merged$celltype.mapped, sample=merged$sample) ) summed ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 14699 186 ## metadata(1): merge.info ## assays(1): counts ## rownames(14699): Xkr4 Rp1 ...

Larger counts are more amenable to downstream analysis with standard methods for bulk RNA-seq analysis. Normalization is more straightforward and certain approximations are more accurate for large counts. Collapsing cells into samples reflects the fact that our biological replication occurs at the sample level (A. T. L. Lun and Marioni 2017). Each sample is represented no more than once for each condition, avoiding problems from unmodelled correlations between samples. Supplying the per-cell counts directly would indicate that each cell is a biological replicate, which is not true from an experimental perspective. Variance between cells within each sample is masked, provided it does not affect variance across (replicate) samples. This avoids penalizing DEGs that are not uniformly up- or down-regulated for all cells in all samples of one condition. Masking is generally desirable as DEGs (unlike marker genes) do not need to have low within-sample variance to be interesting, e.g., if the treatment effect is consistent across populations but heterogeneous on a per-cell basis. 16.3.2 Performing the DE analysis 16.3.2.1 Introduction The DE analysis will be performed using quasi-likelihood (QL) methods from the edgeR package (Robinson, McCarthy, and Smyth 2010; Chen, Lun, and Smyth 2016). This uses a negative binomial generalized linear model (NB GLM) to handle overdispersed count data in experiments with limited replication. In our case, we have biological variation with three paired replicates per condition, so edgeR (or its contemporaries) is a natural choice for the analysis. We do not use all labels for GLM fitting as the strong DE between labels makes it difficult to compute a sensible average abundance to model the mean-dispersion trend. Moreover, label-specific batch effects would not be easily handled with a single additive term in the design matrix for the batch. Instead, we arbitrarily pick one of the labels to use for this demonstration. label &lt;- &quot;Mesenchyme&quot; current &lt;- summed[,label==summed$celltype.mapped] # Creating up a DGEList object for use in edgeR: library(edgeR) y &lt;- DGEList(counts(current), samples=colData(current)) y ## An object of class &quot;DGEList&quot; ## $counts ## Sample1 Sample2 Sample3 Sample4 Sample5 Sample6 ## Xkr4 2 0 0 0 3 0 ## Rp1 0 0 1 0 0 0 ## Sox17 7 0 3 0 14 9 ## Mrpl15 1420 271 1009 379 1578 749 ## Rgs20 3 0 1 1 0 0 ## 14694 more rows ... ## ## $samples ## group lib.size norm.factors batch cell barcode ## Sample1 1 4607053 1 5 cell_9769 AAACCTGAGACTGTAA ## Sample2 1 1064970 1 6 cell_12212 AAGGCAGAGATGCGAC ## Sample3 1 2494010 1 7 cell_13244 AAAGATGGTCATACTG ## Sample4 1 1028668 1 8 cell_16261 AAAGTAGAGCGATCCC ## Sample5 1 4290221 1 9 cell_19345 AAACGGGTCGTCTGAA ## Sample6 1 1950840 1 10 cell_23936 AAAGTAGTCTTGCCGT ## sample stage tomato pool stage.mapped celltype.mapped closest.cell ## Sample1 5 E8.5 TRUE 3 E8.25 Mesenchyme cell_24159 ## Sample2 6 E8.5 FALSE 3 E8.25 Mesenchyme cell_66561 ## Sample3 7 E8.5 TRUE 4 E8.25 Mesenchyme cell_137494 ## Sample4 8 E8.5 FALSE 4 E8.5 Mesenchyme cell_132462 ## Sample5 9 E8.5 TRUE 5 E7.25 Mesenchyme cell_17255 ## Sample6 10 E8.5 FALSE 5 E8.5 Mesenchyme cell_41003 ## doub.density cluster label sample.1 ## Sample1 0.029850 20 Mesenchyme 5 ## Sample2 0.001651 20 Mesenchyme 6 ## Sample3 0.079208 24 Mesenchyme 7 ## Sample4 0.014702 24 Mesenchyme 8 ## Sample5 0.111286 9 Mesenchyme 9 ## Sample6 0.000000 20 Mesenchyme 10 16.3.2.2 Pre-processing A typical step in bulk RNA-seq data analyses is to remove samples with very low library sizes corresponding to failed library preparation or sequencing. In our situation, this is equivalent to removing label-sample combinations that have very few or lowly-sequenced cells. The corresponding summed count vectors are likely to be highly variable and thus reduce power for DE detection. The exact definition of “very low” will vary, but in this case, we define it to be log-library sizes that are more than 3 median absolute deviations from the median. discarded &lt;- isOutlier(y$samples$lib.size, log=TRUE, type=&quot;lower&quot;, nmads=3) y &lt;- y[,!discarded] summary(discarded) ## Mode FALSE ## logical 6 Another typical step in bulk RNA-seq analyses is to remove genes that are lowly expressed. This reduces computational work, improves the accuracy of mean-variance trend modelling and decreases the severity of the multiple testing correction.

The latter is represented in our model as the log-fold change in gene expression in td-Tomato-positive cells over their negative counterparts within the same label.

The BCV is computed as the square root of the NB dispersion after empirical Bayes shrinkage towards the trend. Trended and common BCV estimates are shown in blue and red, respectively. We also estimate the quasi-likelihood dispersions with glmQLFit() (Chen, Lun, and Smyth 2016). This fits a GLM to the counts for each gene and estimates the QL dispersion from the GLM deviance. We set robust=TRUE to avoid distortions from highly variable clusters (Phipson et al. 2016). The QL dispersion models the uncertainty and variability of the per-gene variance (Figure 16.3) - which is not well handled by the NB dispersions, so the two dispersion types complement each other in the final analysis. fit &lt;- glmQLFit(y, design, robust=TRUE) summary(fit$var.prior) ## Min. 1st Qu.

DEGs are defined as those with non-zero log-fold changes at a false discovery rate of 5%. Very few genes are significantly DE, indicating that injection has little effect on the transcriptome of “Mesenchyme” cells. (Note that this logic is somewhat circular, as a large transcriptional effect may have caused cells of this type to be re-assigned to a different label.

This is mostly straightforward as we can write a loop that simply performs the DE analysis for each subset of columns in summed. However, some additional care is required to automatically deal with labels that are not represented in both injected and background cells, for which a DE analysis between conditions is meaningless; or are not represented in a sufficient number of replicate samples to enable modelling of biological variability.

This will reveal which cell types are depleted or enriched upon treatment, which is arguably just as interesting as changes in expression within each cell type. The DA analysis has a long history in flow cytometry (Finak et al. 2014; A. T. L. Lun, Richard, and Marioni 2017) where it is routinely used to examine the effects of different conditions on the composition of complex cell populations. By performing it here, we effectively treat scRNA-seq as a “super-FACS” technology for defining relevant subpopulations using the entire transcriptome. We prepare for the DA analysis by quantifying the number of cells assigned to each label (or cluster). In this case, we are aiming to identify labels that change in abundance among the compartment of injected cells compared to the background. abundances &lt;- table(merged$celltype.mapped, merged$sample) abundances &lt;- unclass(abundances) head(abundances) ## ## 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## Allantois 97 15 139 127 318 259 ## Blood progenitors 1 6 3 16 6 8 17 ## Blood progenitors 2 31 8 28 21 43 114 ## Cardiomyocytes 85 21 79 31 174 211 ## Caudal epiblast 2 2 0 0 22 45 ## Caudal Mesoderm 10 10 9 3 10 29 16.4.2 Performing the DA analysis Our DA analysis will again be performed with the edgeR package. This allows us to take advantage of the NB GLM methods to model overdispersed count data in the presence of limited replication - except that the counts are not of reads per gene, but of cells per label (A. T. L. Lun, Richard, and Marioni 2017). The aim is to share information across labels to improve our estimates of the biological variability in cell abundance between replicates. # Attaching some column metadata. extra.info &lt;- colData(merged)[match(colnames(abundances), merged$sample),] y.ab &lt;- DGEList(abundances, samples=extra.info) y.ab ## An object of class &quot;DGEList&quot; ## $counts ## ## 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## Allantois 97 15 139 127 318 259 ## Blood progenitors 1 6 3 16 6 8 17 ## Blood progenitors 2 31 8 28 21 43 114 ## Cardiomyocytes 85 21 79 31 174 211 ## Caudal epiblast 2 2 0 0 22 45 ## 29 more rows ... ## ## $samples ## group lib.size norm.factors batch cell barcode sample ## 5 1 2298 1 5 cell_9769 AAACCTGAGACTGTAA 5 ## 6 1 1026 1 6 cell_12180 AAACCTGCAGATGGCA 6 ## 7 1 2740 1 7 cell_13227 AAACCTGAGACAAGCC 7 ## 8 1 2904 1 8 cell_16234 AAACCTGCAAACCCAT 8 ## 9 1 4057 1 9 cell_19332 AAACCTGCAACGATCT 9 ## 10 1 6401 1 10 cell_23875 AAACCTGAGGCATGTG 10 ## stage tomato pool stage.mapped celltype.mapped ## 5 E8.5 TRUE 3 E8.25 Mesenchyme ## 6 E8.5 FALSE 3 E8.25 Somitic mesoderm ## 7 E8.5 TRUE 4 E8.5 Somitic mesoderm ## 8 E8.5 FALSE 4 E8.25 ExE mesoderm ## 9 E8.5 TRUE 5 E8.0 ExE mesoderm ## 10 E8.5 FALSE 5 E8.5 Forebrain/Midbrain/Hindbrain ## closest.cell doub.density cluster ## 5 cell_24159 0.029850 20 ## 6 cell_63247 0.291916 6 ## 7 cell_25454 0.601740 18 ## 8 cell_139075 0.004733 9 ## 9 cell_116116 0.079415 12 ## 10 cell_39343 0.040747 1 We filter out low-abundance labels as previously described. This avoids cluttering the result table with very rare subpopulations that contain only a handful of cells.

This means that we are only normalizing based on the “library size”, i.e., the total number of cells in each sample. Any changes we detect between conditions will subsequently represent differences in the proportion of cells in each cluster. The motivation behind this decision is discussed in more detail in Section 16.4.3. We formulate the design matrix with a blocking factor for the batch of origin for each sample and an additive term for the td-Tomato status (i.e., injection effect). Here, the log-fold change in our model refers to the change in cell abundance after injection, rather than the change in gene expression. design &lt;- model.matrix(~factor(pool) + factor(tomato), y.ab$samples) We use the estimateDisp() function to estimate the NB dipersion for each cluster (Figure 16.4).

We test for differences in abundance between td-Tomato-positive and negative samples using glmQLFTest(). We see that extra-embryonic ectoderm is strongly depleted in the injected cells. This is consistent with the expectation that cells injected into the blastocyst should not contribute to extra-embryonic tissue.

This step assumes that most of the input features are not different between conditions. While this is reasonable for most gene expression data, we cannot always say the same for cell abundance - it is generally too strong to assume that most cell types do not change in abundance between conditions. Thus, our default approach is to only normalize based on the total number of cells in each sample, which means that we are effectively testing for differential proportions between conditions. Unfortunately, the use of the total number of cells leaves us susceptible to composition effects. For example, a large increase in abundance for one cell subpopulation will introduce decreases in proportion for all other subpopulations - which is technically correct, but may be misleading if one concludes that those other subpopulations are decreasing in abundance of their own volition. If composition biases are proving problematic for interpretation of DA results, we have several avenues for removing them or mitigating their impact by leveraging a priori biological knowledge. 16.4.3.2 Assuming most labels do not change If it is possible to assume that most labels (i.e., cell types) do not change in abundance, we can use calcNormFactors() to compute normalization factors. This seems to be a fairly reasonable assumption for the WT chimeras where the injection is expected to have only a modest effect at most. y.ab2 &lt;- calcNormFactors(y.ab) y.ab2$samples$norm.factors ## [1] 1.0055 1.0833 1.1658 0.7614 1.0616 0.9743 We then proceed with the remainder of the edgeR analysis, shown below in condensed format. Many of the positive log-fold changes are shifted towards zero, consistent with the removal of composition biases from the presence of extra-embryonic ectoderm in only background cells.

For example, if we collected a whole blood data set, we could subset to T cells and test for changes in T cell subtypes (memory, killer, regulatory, etc.) using the total number of T cells in each sample as the library size. This avoids detecting changes in T cell subsets that are driven by compositional effects from changes in abundance of, say, B cells in the same sample. 16.4.3.4 Testing against a log-fold change threshold Here, we assume that composition bias introduces a spurious log2-fold change of no more than \\(\\tau\\) for a non-DA label. This can be roughly interpreted as the maximum log-fold change in the total number of cells caused by DA in other labels. (By comparison, fold-differences in the totals due to differences in capture efficiency or the size of the original cell population are not attributable to composition bias and should not be considered when choosing \\(\\tau\\).) We then mitigate the effect of composition biases by testing each label for changes in abundance beyond \\(\\tau\\) (McCarthy and Smyth 2009; A. T. L. Lun, Richard, and Marioni 2017). res.lfc &lt;- glmTreat(fit.ab, coef=ncol(design), lfc=1) summary(decideTests(res.lfc)) ## factor(tomato)TRUE ## Down 1 ## NotSig 23 ## Up 0 topTags(res.lfc) ## Coefficient: factor(tomato)TRUE ## logFC unshrunk.logFC logCPM PValue ## ExE ectoderm -6.5663 -7.0015 13.02 2.626e-09 ## Mesenchyme 1.1652 1.1658 16.29 1.323e-01 ## Cardiomyocytes 0.8484 0.8498 14.86 3.796e-01 ## Allantois 0.8345 0.8354 15.51 3.975e-01 ## Neural crest -0.7706 -0.7719 14.76 4.501e-01 ## Endothelium 0.7519 0.7536 14.29 4.665e-01 ## Haematoendothelial progenitors 0.6581 0.6591 14.72 5.622e-01 ## Def. endoderm 0.5262 0.5311 12.40 5.934e-01 ## Erythroid3 -0.6431 -0.6432 17.28 6.118e-01 ## Caudal Mesoderm -0.3996 -0.4036 12.09 6.827e-01 ## FDR ## ExE ectoderm 6.303e-08 ## Mesenchyme 9.950e-01 ## Cardiomyocytes 9.950e-01 ## Allantois 9.950e-01 ## Neural crest 9.950e-01 ## Endothelium 9.950e-01 ## Haematoendothelial progenitors 9.950e-01 ## Def. endoderm 9.950e-01 ## Erythroid3 9.950e-01 ## Caudal Mesoderm 9.950e-01 The choice of \\(\\tau\\) can be loosely motivated by external experimental data. For example, if we observe a doubling of cell numbers in an in vitro system after treatment, we might be inclined to set \\(\\tau=1\\). This ensures that any non-DA subpopulation is not reported as being depleted after treatment. Some caution is still required, though - even if the external numbers are accurate, we need to assume that cell capture efficiency is (on average) equal between conditions to justify their use as \\(\\tau\\). And obviously, the use of a non-zero \\(\\tau\\) will reduce power to detect real changes when the composition bias is not present. 16.5 DE or DA? Two sides of the same coin While useful, the distinction between DA and DE analyses is inherently artificial for scRNA-seq data. This is because the labels used in the former are defined based on the genes to be tested in the latter. To illustrate, consider a scRNA-seq experiment involving two biological conditions with several shared cell types. We focus on a cell type \\(X\\) that is present in both conditions but contains some DEGs between conditions. This leads to two possible outcomes: The DE between conditions causes \\(X\\) to form two separate clusters (say, \\(X_1\\) and \\(X_2\\)) in expression space. This manifests as DA where \\(X_1\\) is enriched in one condition and \\(X_2\\) is enriched in the other condition. The DE between conditions is not sufficient to split \\(X\\) into two separate clusters, e.g., because the data integration procedure identifies them as corresponding cell types and merges them together. This means that the differences between conditions manifest as DE within the single cluster corresponding to \\(X\\). We have described the example above in terms of clustering, but the same arguments apply for any labelling strategy based on the expression profiles, e.g., automated cell type assignment (Chapter ???). Moreover, the choice between outcomes 1 and 2 is made implicitly by the combined effect of the data merging, clustering and label assignment procedures. For example, differences between conditions are more likely to manifest as DE for coarser clusters but as DA for finer clusters, but this is difficult to predict reliably. The moral of the story is that DA and DE analyses are simply two different perspectives on the same phenomena. For any comprehensive characterization of differences between populations, it is usually necessary to consider both analyses. Indeed, they complement each other almost by definition, e.g., a clustering that reduces DE will increase DA and vice versa. 16.6 Avoiding problems with ambient RNA 16.6.1 Motivation Ambient contamination is a phenomenon that is generally most pronounced in massively multiplexed scRNA-seq protocols. Differences in the ambient profile across samples are not uncommon when dealing with strong experimental perturbations. This is problematic for DE analyses between conditions, as DEGs detected for a particular cell type may be driven by differences in the ambient profiles rather than any intrinsic change in gene regulation. To illustrate, we consider the Tal1-knockout (KO) chimera data from (???). This is very similar to the WT chimera dataset we previously examined, only differing in that the Tal1 gene was knocked out in the injected cells. Tal1 is a transcription factor that has known roles in erythroid differentiation; the aim of the experiment was to determine if blocking of the erythroid lineage diverted cells to other developmental fates. library(MouseGastrulationData) sce.tal1 &lt;- Tal1ChimeraData() rownames(sce.tal1) &lt;- uniquifyFeatureNames( rowData(sce.tal1)$ENSEMBL, rowData(sce.tal1)$SYMBOL) sce.tal1 ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 29453 56122 ## metadata(0): ## assays(1): counts ## rownames(29453): Xkr4 Gm1992 ...

This is rather surprising as cells undergoing neuronal development should not express hemoglobins in the first place27. The most sober explanation is that the background samples contain more hemoglobin transcripts in the ambient solution due to leakage from erythrocytes (or their precursors) during sorting and dissociation. summed.tal1 &lt;- aggregateAcrossCells(sce.tal1, ids=DataFrame(sample=sce.tal1$sample, label=sce.tal1$celltype.mapped) ) summed.neural &lt;- summed.tal1[,summed.tal1$label==&quot;Neural crest&quot;] summed.neural ## class: SingleCellExperiment ## dim: 29453 4 ## metadata(0): ## assays(1): counts ## rownames(29453): Xkr4 Gm1992 ...

To mitigate its effects, we need to obtain an estimate of the ambient “expression” profile by going back to the raw count matrix for each sample. We follow the approach used in emptyDrops() (Lun et al. 2019) and consider all barcodes with total counts below 100 to represent empty droplets. raw.tal1 &lt;- Tal1ChimeraData(type=&quot;raw&quot;) library(Matrix) ambient &lt;- vector(&quot;list&quot;, length(raw.tal1)) for (i in seq_along(raw.tal1)) { curmat &lt;- counts(raw.tal1[[i]]) is.empty &lt;- colSums(curmat) &lt; 100 ambient[[i]] &lt;- rowSums(curmat[,is.empty]) } ambient &lt;- do.call(cbind, ambient) colnames(ambient) &lt;- names(raw.tal1) rownames(ambient) &lt;- uniquifyFeatureNames( rowData(raw.tal1[[1]])$ENSEMBL, rowData(raw.tal1[[1]])$SYMBOL) head(ambient) ## 1 2 3 4 ## Xkr4 1 0 0 0 ## Gm1992 0 0 0 0 ## Gm37381 1 0 1 0 ## Rp1 0 1 0 1 ## Sox17 75 76 31 53 ## Gm37323 0 0 0 0 Given prior knowledge of mutually exclusive gene expression profiles, we estimate the contribution of ambient RNA to each sample (???) and subtract it to remove the effects of ambient contamination. In our case, we assume (reasonably) that hemoglobins should not be expressed in neural crest cells and use this to estimate the contamination rate in each sample. is.hbb &lt;- grep(&quot;^Hb[ab]-&quot;, rownames(summed.neural)) neural.hb &lt;- colSums(counts(summed.neural)[is.hbb,]) ambient.hb &lt;- colSums(ambient[is.hbb,]) con.rate &lt;- neural.hb/ambient.hb data.frame(neural=neural.hb, ambient=ambient.hb, rate=con.rate) ## neural ambient rate ## 1 47 13153 0.003573 ## 2 60 12933 0.004639 ## 3 23938 300274 0.079721 ## 4 26383 371826 0.070955 We scale the ambient counts by this rate compute the proportion of ambient contribution to each gene. Genes in which over 10% of the counts are ambient-derived are discarded from our analysis. This yields a slightly smaller list of DEGs without the hemoglobins - by definition, but encouraging nonetheless as it suggests that any other (less obvious) effects of ambient contamination have also been removed. scaled.ambient &lt;- t(t(ambient) * con.rate) ratio &lt;- rowMeans(scaled.ambient) / rowMeans(counts(summed.neural)) non.ambient &lt;- ratio &lt; 0.1 summary(non.ambient) ## Mode FALSE TRUE NA&#39;s ## logical 4290 14869 10294 okay.genes &lt;- names(non.ambient)[which(non.ambient)] res.neural2 &lt;- res.neural[rownames(res.neural) %in% okay.genes,] summary(decideTests(res.neural2)) ## factor(tomato)TRUE ## Down 315 ## NotSig 9574 ## Up 452 topTags(res.neural2) ## Coefficient: factor(tomato)TRUE ## logFC logCPM F PValue FDR ## Xist -7.5557 8.212 6657.3 0.000e+00 0.000e+00 ## Erdr1 1.8895 7.616 1407.1 2.347e-289 1.213e-285 ## Uba52 -0.8797 8.386 424.2 1.866e-92 6.432e-89 ## Grb10 -1.4034 6.583 401.4 1.139e-87 2.945e-84 ## Gt(ROSA)26Sor 1.4813 5.716 351.9 2.801e-77 5.792e-74 ## Fdps 0.9814 7.218 337.2 3.677e-74 6.337e-71 ## Mest 0.5493 10.983 319.7 1.798e-70 2.657e-67 ## Impact 1.3967 5.718 314.7 2.051e-69 2.651e-66 ## H13 -1.4817 5.909 301.7 1.174e-66 1.349e-63 ## Msmo1 1.4938 5.439 301.1 1.580e-66 1.634e-63 16.6.3 Subtracting ambient counts It is worth commenting on the seductive idea of subtracting the ambient counts from the pseudo-bulk samples. This may seem like the most obvious approach for removing ambient contamination. Unfortunately, subtracted counts have unpredictable statistical properties due the distortion of the mean-variance relationship. Minor relative fluctuations at very large counts become large fold-changes after subtraction, manifesting as spurious DE in genes where a substantial proportion of counts is derived from the ambient solution. For example, several hemoglobin genes retain strong DE even after subtraction of the scaled ambient profile. subtracted &lt;- counts(summed.neural) - scaled.ambient subtracted &lt;- round(subtracted) subtracted[subtracted &lt; 0] &lt;- 0 subtracted[is.hbb,] ## 8 x 4 Matrix of class &quot;dgeMatrix&quot; ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## Hbb-bt 0 0 7 18 ## Hbb-bs 1 2 31 42 ## Hbb-bh2 0 0 1 0 ## Hbb-bh1 2 0 0 0 ## Hbb-y 0 0 32 106 ## Hba-x 1 1 0 0 ## Hba-a1 0 0 365 451 ## Hba-a2 0 0 313 330 Another tempting approach is to use interaction models to implicitly subtract the ambient effect during GLM fitting. The assumption would be that, for genuine DEGs, the log-fold change within cells is larger in magnitude than those in the ambient solution (where the effect would be diluted by contributions from cell types where the gene is not DE). However, this is not always the case - a DE analysis of the ambient counts indicates that the hemoglobin log-fold change is actually stronger in the neural crest cells compared to the ambient solution, which leads to a rather awkward conclusion. # Re-using keep.neural to simplify comparison. y.ambient &lt;- DGEList(ambient) y.ambient &lt;- y.ambient[keep.neural,] y.ambient &lt;- calcNormFactors(y.ambient) y.ambient &lt;- estimateDisp(y.ambient, design) fit.ambient &lt;- glmQLFit(y.ambient, design, robust=TRUE) res.ambient &lt;- glmQLFTest(fit.ambient, coef=ncol(design)) summary(decideTests(res.ambient)) ## factor(tomato)TRUE ## Down 1581 ## NotSig 7742 ## Up 1327 topTags(res.ambient, n=10) ## Coefficient: factor(tomato)TRUE ## logFC logCPM F PValue FDR ## Hbb-y -5.244 12.797 16646 2.281e-28 2.430e-24 ## Hba-x -4.805 13.117 13773 1.272e-27 6.744e-24 ## Hbb-bh1 -5.049 13.716 13178 1.900e-27 6.744e-24 ## Hba-a1 -4.640 10.728 11847 4.992e-27 1.329e-23 ## Hba-a2 -4.498 9.473 8862 6.938e-26 1.478e-22 ## Blvrb -4.301 7.645 4073 7.931e-23 1.408e-19 ## Xist -4.361 7.489 4004 9.255e-23 1.408e-19 ## Gypa -5.113 7.208 3846 1.331e-22 1.695e-19 ## Car2 -3.492 8.532 3815 1.433e-22 1.695e-19 ## Hbb-bs -4.915 7.203 3418 3.869e-22 4.120e-19 Session Info View session info R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05) Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) Running under: Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS Matrix products: default BLAS/LAPACK: /app/easybuild/software/OpenBLAS/0.2.18-GCC-5.4.0-2.26-LAPACK-3.6.1/lib/libopenblas_prescottp-r0.2.18.so locale: [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8 [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C attached base packages: [1] parallel stats4 stats graphics grDevices utils datasets [8] methods base other attached packages: [1] Matrix_1.2-17 MouseGastrulationData_0.99.12 [3] edgeR_3.27.12 limma_3.41.15 [5] scater_1.13.17 ggplot2_3.2.1 [7] BiocSingular_1.1.5 SingleCellExperiment_1.7.7 [9] SummarizedExperiment_1.15.8 DelayedArray_0.11.4 [11] BiocParallel_1.19.2 matrixStats_0.54.0 [13] Biobase_2.45.0 GenomicRanges_1.37.14 [15] GenomeInfoDb_1.21.1 IRanges_2.19.14 [17] S4Vectors_0.23.20 BiocGenerics_0.31.5 [19] BiocStyle_2.13.2 Cairo_1.5-10 loaded via a namespace (and not attached): [1] bitops_1.0-6 bit64_0.9-7 [3] RColorBrewer_1.1-2 httr_1.4.1 [5] tools_3.6.1 backports_1.1.4 [7] R6_2.4.0 irlba_2.3.3 [9] vipor_0.4.5 DBI_1.0.0 [11] lazyeval_0.2.2 colorspace_1.4-1 [13] withr_2.1.2 tidyselect_0.2.5 [15] gridExtra_2.3 curl_4.0 [17] bit_1.1-14 compiler_3.6.1 [19] BiocNeighbors_1.3.3 labeling_0.3 [21] bookdown_0.13 scales_1.0.0 [23] rappdirs_0.3.1 stringr_1.4.0 [25] digest_0.6.20 rmarkdown_1.13 [27] XVector_0.25.0 pkgconfig_2.0.2 [29] htmltools_0.3.6 dbplyr_1.4.2 [31] highr_0.8 rlang_0.4.0 [33] RSQLite_2.1.2 shiny_1.3.2 [35] DelayedMatrixStats_1.7.1 dplyr_0.8.3 [37] RCurl_1.95-4.12 magrittr_1.5 [39] GenomeInfoDbData_1.2.1 Rcpp_1.0.2 [41] ggbeeswarm_0.6.0 munsell_0.5.0 [43] viridis_0.5.1 stringi_1.4.3 [45] yaml_2.2.0 zlibbioc_1.31.0 [47] BiocFileCache_1.9.1 AnnotationHub_2.17.7 [49] grid_3.6.1 blob_1.2.0 [51] promises_1.0.1 ExperimentHub_1.11.4 [53] crayon_1.3.4 lattice_0.20-38 [55] cowplot_0.9.4 splines_3.6.1 [57] locfit_1.5-9.1 zeallot_0.1.0 [59] knitr_1.24 pillar_1.4.2 [61] glue_1.3.1 evaluate_0.14 [63] BiocManager_1.30.4 httpuv_1.5.1 [65] vctrs_0.2.0 gtable_0.3.0 [67] purrr_0.3.2 assertthat_0.2.1 [69] xfun_0.9 mime_0.7 [71] rsvd_1.0.2 xtable_1.8-4 [73] later_0.8.0 viridisLite_0.3.0 [75] tibble_2.1.3 pheatmap_1.0.12 [77] AnnotationDbi_1.47.1 beeswarm_0.2.3 [79] memoise_1.1.0 statmod_1.4.32 [81] interactiveDisplayBase_1.23.0 References Bibliography "],

Modern high-throughput technologies have been used to generate biological datasets of increasing size and complexity, including single-cell genomics and multi-omics experiments. As a consequence, the need for flexible and interactive platforms to explore those data from various angles has contributed to the increasing popularity of interactive graphical user interfaces (GUI). In this chapter, we illustrate how the Bioconductor package iSEE can be used to perform some common exploratory tasks during single-cell analysis workflows. We note that these are examples only; in practice, EDA is often context-dependent and driven by distinct motivations and hypotheses for every new data set. To this end, iSEE provides a flexible framework immediately compatible with a wide range of genomics data modalities and offers tools for building custom interactive interfaces configured to draw special attention to key aspects of individual data sets. 17.2 Quick start In this chapter, we use the 10X PBMC dataset for demonstration purposes.

In its simplest form, this is done simply by calling iSEE(sce) with the sce data object as the sole argument, as illustrated here with the sce.pbmc data set. iSEE(sce.pbmc) The default interface contains up to eight standard panels, each featuring a particular aspect of the data set. The names of standard panels are available in the panelTypes variable. The shorter panel codes are useful for the configuration of tours, described in the section Dissemination of analysis results. panelTypes ## redDimPlot colDataPlot ## &quot;Reduced dimension plot&quot; &quot;Column data plot&quot; ## featAssayPlot rowStatTable ## &quot;Feature assay plot&quot; &quot;Row statistics table&quot; ## rowDataPlot sampAssayPlot ## &quot;Row data plot&quot; &quot;Sample assay plot&quot; ## colStatTable customDataPlot ## &quot;Column statistics table&quot; &quot;Custom data plot&quot; ## customStatTable heatMapPlot ## &quot;Custom statistics table&quot; &quot;Heat map&quot; The layout of panels in the interface may be altered interactively: panels can be added, removed, resized or repositioned using the “Organize panels” menu in the top right corner of the interface. The initial layout in which an application is launched can also be altered programmatically (see section Examples of usages for iSEE apps). To familiarize themselves with the GUI, users can launch an interactive tour from the menu in the top right corner. In addition, custom tours can be written to substitute the default built-in tour. This feature is particularly useful to disseminate new data sets with accompanying bespoke explanations guiding users through the salient features of any given data set (see section Dissemination of analysis results). It is also possible to deploy “empty” instances of iSEE apps, where any SummarizedExperiment object stored in an RDS file may be uploaded to the running application. Once the file is uploaded, the application will import the sce object and initialize the GUI panels with the contents of the object for interactive exploration. This type of iSEE applications is launched without specifying the sce argument, as shown below. iSEE() 17.3 Examples of usages for iSEE apps In the following subsections, we demonstrate some examples of use cases that can be addressed with interactive iSEE applications to gain insights into a data set and inform decision-making for downstream analyses. In each case, we demonstrate how iSEE applications can be preconfigured to launch in a specific state and layout, to facilitate immediate exploration of key aspects of the data set, in a manner most directly relevant to each situation and objectives. We note that these are examples only; we encourage readers to consider them as templates for learning and developing applications adapted to their own specific needs and purposes. 17.3.1 Quality control Having previously computed quality control metrics (see section Quick start above), it is possible to launch an app instance that immediately displays a set of panels preconfigured to focus on selected quality control metrics. For example, a common view for initial inspection of single-cell RNA-sequencing data sets generated by microfluidics platforms plots the library size of each cell, in decreasing order. An elbow in this plot generally reveals the transition between good quality cells and low quality cells or empty droplets. Another common view is to overlay the library size (in log space) as a color gradient over the result of a dimensionality reduction method such as t-SNE, UMAP, or ivis (Van der Maaten and Hinton 2008; McInnes, Healy, and Melville 2018; Szubert et al. 2019). This view may reveal trajectories or clusters associated with library size. Depending on the experimental context, such observations may result from technical or biological phenomena. For instance, it may indicate that normalization was not completely effective at removing cell biases. Alternatively, it could also indicate the presence of multiple cell types or states that differ in total RNA content. In the example below, we demonstrate that an iSEE app can be preconfigured to immediately display the views described above. # Rank cells by decreasing library size colData(sce.pbmc)[[&quot;total_counts_rank&quot;]] &lt;- rank(-colData(sce.pbmc)[[&quot;total_counts&quot;]]) # Configure a &quot;Column data plot&quot; panel colDataArgs &lt;- colDataPlotDefaults(sce.pbmc, 1) colDataArgs$YAxis &lt;- &quot;log10_total_counts&quot; colDataArgs$XAxis &lt;- &quot;Column data&quot; colDataArgs$XAxisColData &lt;- &quot;total_counts_rank&quot; colDataArgs$DataBoxOpen &lt;- TRUE # Configure a &quot;Reduced dimension plot &quot; panel redDimArgs &lt;- redDimPlotDefaults(sce.pbmc, 1) redDimArgs$Type &lt;- &quot;TSNE&quot; redDimArgs$ColorBy &lt;- &quot;Column data&quot; redDimArgs$ColorByColData &lt;- &quot;log10_total_counts&quot; redDimArgs$DataBoxOpen &lt;- TRUE redDimArgs$VisualBoxOpen &lt;- TRUE # Configure the set of panels initially visible initialPanels &lt;- DataFrame( Name = c(&quot;Column data plot 1&quot;, &quot;Reduced dimension plot 1&quot;), Width = c(6L, 6L) ) # Prepare the app app &lt;- iSEE(sce.pbmc, colDataArgs = colDataArgs, redDimArgs = redDimArgs, initialPanels = initialPanels) The preconfigured Shiny app can then be launched as show below. runApp(app) Note that preconfigured apps remain fully interactive, meaning that users can interactively control the settings and layout of the panels. For instance, users may select cells in one panel and choose to highlight the selected cells in the other using the “Selection parameters” collapsible box, in an effort to determine an adequate threshold on the library size to filter cells to retain for downstream analyses. Users may also change the information displayed in any panel. For instance, users may choose to color data points by percentage of UMI mapped to mitochondrial genes (“pct_counts_Mito”) in the “Reduced dimension plot 1”. Using the transfer of point selection between panels, users could select cells with small library sizes (in the “Column data plot 1” panel) and highlight them in the “Reduced dimension plot 1” panel, to investigate a possible relation between library size, clustering, and proportion of reads mapped to mitochondrial genes. 17.3.2 Annotation and identification of cell populations Recent efforts such as the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) and the NIH Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) have initiated the creation of reference maps of cell types and states in the human body in health and disease. A direct challenge of such efforts lies in the curation and annotation of known and novel cell types in those data sets, and the subsequent transfer learning of those annotations to new data sets. This generally relies on unsupervised clustering of cells, followed by pairwise differential expression to identify gene markers for each cluster, and ultimately manual curation of gene signatures to assign a cell type identity - either known or novel - to each cluster. In this example, we show how iSEE can be used to interactively examine results from unsupervised clustering and pairwise differential expression to conveniently inspect and determine cell identities. In this first code chunk, we identify clusters of cells and their respective positive markers; that is, genes expressed at higher levels in the cluster of interest relative to other cells. The clusters are identified as densely connected subgraphs within a k-nearest-neighbors graph of cells based on their expression profiles. Positive markers are identified as genes with a significantly higher mean expression in each cluster using pairwise Welch t-tests. Finally, the log-transformed false discovery rate (FDR) of each marker for each cluster is stored in the rowData component of the sce object, which will then be accessible in the iSEE application. library(scran) # Compute cell clusters g &lt;- buildSNNGraph(sce.pbmc, k=10, use.dimred = &#39;PCA&#39;) clust &lt;- igraph::cluster_walktrap(g)$membership sce.pbmc$cluster &lt;- factor(clust) # Identify positive markers for each cluster markers.pbmc.up &lt;- findMarkers( sce.pbmc, sce.pbmc$cluster, direction=&quot;up&quot;, log.p=TRUE, sorted=FALSE) # Collate the log-transformed FDR for each marker in a single table x &lt;- DataFrame( row.names = rownames(sce.pbmc), lapply(X = markers.pbmc.up, FUN = &quot;[[&quot;, i=&quot;log.FDR&quot;) ) colnames(x) &lt;- as.character(seq_len(ncol(x))) # Store the table of results as row metadata rowData(sce.pbmc)[[(paste0(&quot;log.FDR&quot;, &quot;.markers.up&quot;))]] &lt;- x The next code chunk preconfigures an app that shows: - A table of feature statistics (including the log-transformed FDR of cluster markers computed above), - A plot showing the distribution of expression values for a chosen gene in each cluster, - A plot showing the result of the UMAP dimensionality reduction method overlaid with the expression value of a chosen gene. Moreover, the code chunk below preconfigures the second and third panel to use the gene (i.e., row) selected in the first panel. This functionality is particularly convenient once the table is sorted by decreasing significance of the markers for a given cluster. For instance, once the application is launched, users can sort the table by ascending value of “log.FDR.markers.up:1” (where “:1” indicates cluster “1”). Then, users may select the first row in the “Row statistics table 1” and watch the second and third panel automatically regenerate to display the most significant marker gene on the y-axis (“Feature assay plot 1” panel), and as a color scale overlaid on the data points (“Reduced dimension plot 1” panel). # Configure a &quot;Row statistics table&quot; panel (NOTE: we leave all parameters to default) rowStatArgs &lt;- rowStatTableDefaults(sce.pbmc, 1) # Configure a &quot;Feature assay plot&quot; panel featAssayArgs &lt;- featAssayPlotDefaults(sce.pbmc, 1) featAssayArgs$YAxisRowTable &lt;- &quot;Row statistics table 1&quot; featAssayArgs$XAxis &lt;- &quot;Column data&quot; featAssayArgs$XAxisColData &lt;- &quot;cluster&quot; featAssayArgs$DataBoxOpen &lt;- TRUE # Configure a &quot;Reduced dimension plot&quot; panel redDimArgs &lt;- redDimPlotDefaults(sce.pbmc, 1) redDimArgs$Type &lt;- &quot;UMAP&quot; redDimArgs$ColorBy &lt;- &quot;Feature name&quot; redDimArgs$ColorByRowTable &lt;- &quot;Row statistics table 1&quot; redDimArgs$VisualBoxOpen &lt;- TRUE initialPanels &lt;- DataFrame( Name = c(&quot;Row statistics table 1&quot;, &quot;Feature assay plot 1&quot;, &quot;Reduced dimension plot 1&quot;), Width = c(4L, 4L, 4L) ) # Prepare the app app &lt;- iSEE(sce.pbmc, rowStatArgs = rowStatArgs, featAssayArgs = featAssayArgs, redDimArgs = redDimArgs, initialPanels = initialPanels) The preconfigured Shiny app can then be launched as show below. runApp(app) In addition to selecting the top genes by significance, it is also possible to search the table for arbitrary gene names and select any known marker gene. Practically, investigating the expression levels of known marker genes is a common approach to assigning cell type labels to inferred clusters. 17.3.3 Collaborative analysis Analysis and interpretation of complex data sets typically involves multiple analysts. Rather than sharing analysis results via multiple versions of static figures and reports, it is often helpful to share interactive plots, allowing the other involved parties to independently explore the data in further depth. With iSEE, this can be achieved at any time by clicking on the “Display panel settings” button under the “Diagnostics” tab in the top right corner, copying the displayed code into an R script, and sharing this chunk of code with collaborators. However, note that they will also need to have access to a copy of the original sce object used for the analysis. In that setup, executing the code in the script and launching iSEE with the following command will open an instance mimicking what was shown on the screen when the “Display panel settings” button was clicked. It is important to note that all iSEE applications remain interactive irrespective of their initial configuration; only the initial layout and state of the application is modified from the default setup. 17.3.4 Dissemination of analysis results Typically, results from single-cell data are disseminated as static figures in published papers and reports. However, those are unlikely to capture the full information content of a complex scRNA-seq data set, and do not allow further exploration by the reader. To complement this traditional mode of dissemination, it is becoming increasingly common to deploy web-based interactive data browsers, allowing interested readers to investigate their respective hypotheses using the published data. With iSEE, such interactive exploration is facilitated by small guided tours - step-by-step walkthroughs of the different panels with pointers to facilitate their interpretation, from the authors’ point of view. At any time, the viewer is still free to leave the interactive tour and explore the data from their own perspective. All that is needed to add a tour to an iSEE instance is a data frame with two columns named “element” and “intro”; the first column declares the UI element to highlight in each step of the tour, and the second one contains the text to display at that step. This data frame must then be provided to the iSEE() function via the tour argument. In the code chunk below, we demonstrate the implementation of a simple tour taking through the two panels that compose a GUI, and interactively train users to use the collapsible boxes. tour &lt;- data.frame( element = c( &quot;#Welcome&quot;, &quot;#redDimPlot1&quot;, &quot;#colDataPlot1&quot;, &quot;#colDataPlot1_DataBoxOpen&quot;, &quot;#Conclusion&quot;), intro = c( &quot;Welcome to this tour!&quot;, &quot;This is a &lt;i&gt;Reduced dimension plot.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;And this is a &lt;i&gt;Column data plot.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;b&gt;Action:&lt;/b&gt; Click on this collapsible box to open and close it.&quot;, &quot;Thank you for taking this tour!&quot;), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) initialPanels &lt;- DataFrame( Name = c(&quot;Reduced dimension plot 1&quot;, &quot;Column data plot 1&quot;), Width = c(6L, 6L) ) The preconfigured Shiny app can then be loaded with the tour and launched as show below. iSEE(sce.pbmc, initialPanels = initialPanels, tour = tour) Examples of advanced tours showcasing a selection of published data sets can be found at https://github.com/LTLA/iSEE2018. 17.4 Reproducibility Although this chapter focuses on interactive exploration of data, we note that it is important to retain reproducibility, and to have a record of how each figure was generated. With iSEE, this information is readily available via the “Export R code” button under the “Diagnostics” tab in the top-right corner of the GUI. At any time, copying the code displayed in the modal window and executing it in the R session from which the iSEE app was launched exactly reproduces all plots currently displayed in the GUI. 17.5 Additional resources For demontration and inspiration, we refer readers to the following examples of deployed applications: Use cases accompanying the published article: https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/ (source code: https://github.com/LTLA/iSEE2018) Examples of iSEE in production: http://www.teichlab.org/singlecell-treg Other examples as source code: Gallery of examples notebooks to reproduce analyses on public data: https://github.com/federicomarini/iSEE_instances Gallery of example custom panels: https://github.com/kevinrue/iSEE_custom Session Info View session info R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05) Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) Running under: Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS Matrix products: default BLAS/LAPACK: /app/easybuild/software/OpenBLAS/0.2.18-GCC-5.4.0-2.26-LAPACK-3.6.1/lib/libopenblas_prescottp-r0.2.18.so locale: [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8 [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C attached base packages: [1] parallel stats4 stats graphics grDevices utils datasets [8] methods base other attached packages: [1] scran_1.13.13 shiny_1.3.2 [3] iSEE_1.5.8 SingleCellExperiment_1.7.7 [5] SummarizedExperiment_1.15.8 DelayedArray_0.11.4 [7] BiocParallel_1.19.2 matrixStats_0.54.0 [9] Biobase_2.45.0 GenomicRanges_1.37.14 [11] GenomeInfoDb_1.21.1 IRanges_2.19.14 [13] S4Vectors_0.23.20 BiocGenerics_0.31.5 [15] BiocStyle_2.13.2 Cairo_1.5-10 loaded via a namespace (and not attached): [1] nlme_3.1-140 bitops_1.0-6 [3] bit64_0.9-7 tools_3.6.1 [5] backports_1.1.4 irlba_2.3.3 [7] R6_2.4.0 DT_0.7 [9] vipor_0.4.5 DBI_1.0.0 [11] lazyeval_0.2.2 mgcv_1.8-28 [13] colorspace_1.4-1 gridExtra_2.3 [15] tidyselect_0.2.5 bit_1.1-14 [17] compiler_3.6.1 BiocNeighbors_1.3.3 [19] shinyjs_1.0 colourpicker_1.0 [21] bookdown_0.13 scales_1.0.0 [23] stringr_1.4.0 digest_0.6.20 [25] rmarkdown_1.13 rentrez_1.2.2 [27] XVector_0.25.0 scater_1.13.17 [29] pkgconfig_2.0.2 htmltools_0.3.6 [31] limma_3.41.15 htmlwidgets_1.3 [33] rlang_0.4.0 RSQLite_2.1.2 [35] DelayedMatrixStats_1.7.1 jsonlite_1.6 [37] dplyr_0.8.3 BiocSingular_1.1.5 [39] RCurl_1.95-4.12 magrittr_1.5 [41] GenomeInfoDbData_1.2.1 Matrix_1.2-17 [43] ggbeeswarm_0.6.0 Rcpp_1.0.2 [45] munsell_0.5.0 viridis_0.5.1 [47] edgeR_3.27.12 stringi_1.4.3 [49] yaml_2.2.0 rintrojs_0.2.2 [51] zlibbioc_1.31.0 plyr_1.8.4 [53] grid_3.6.1 blob_1.2.0 [55] dqrng_0.2.1 promises_1.0.1 [57] shinydashboard_0.7.1 crayon_1.3.4 [59] miniUI_0.1.1.1 lattice_0.20-38 [61] cowplot_0.9.4 splines_3.6.1 [63] locfit_1.5-9.1 zeallot_0.1.0 [65] knitr_1.24 pillar_1.4.2 [67] igraph_1.2.4.1 reshape2_1.4.3 [69] XML_3.98-1.20 glue_1.3.1 [71] evaluate_0.14 BiocManager_1.30.4 [73] vctrs_0.2.0 httpuv_1.5.1 [75] gtable_0.3.0 purrr_0.3.2 [77] assertthat_0.2.1 ggplot2_3.2.1 [79] xfun_0.9 rsvd_1.0.2 [81] mime_0.7 xtable_1.8-4 [83] later_0.8.0 viridisLite_0.3.0 [85] tibble_2.1.3 beeswarm_0.2.3 [87] AnnotationDbi_1.47.1 memoise_1.1.0 [89] statmod_1.4.32 shinyAce_0.4.0 References Bibliography "],

Here, we briefly cover topics that aim to ease working with scRNA-seq data to make it faster and more tractable. Do note however that these adaptations do not universally result in improved computational efficiency. For example, parallelization does incur costs, and disk-backed data representation will generally be slower than purely in-memory representations. In both cases, hardware specifics may dictate any potential gains in efficiency, as can be imagined in the case of a solid state drive (SSD) being faster for disk-backed data representations relative to a hard disk drive (HDD). Thus, with the right compute environment, data, and task, these adaptations can yield significant computational improvements. 18.1 Approximate Methods A general approach that works across all scales of data involves changing the task itself. Some methods - such as PCA or nearest neighbor searches - have been extended to include versions that provide approximate results. Generally, these adaptations result in acceptable losses in accuracy for significant computational gains. In some cases, approximate methods may even be desirable for the results themselves, as has been shown by the FIt-SNE approach. Some example packages that provide approximate versions of popular methods include: BiocSingular via the IrlbaParam() and RandomParam() for approximate singular value decomposition (SVD) BiocNeighbors via the AnnoyParam() for approximate nearest neighbor searches These packages provide users (and developers) a common interface, enabling modular swapping of key algorithms within functions. For example, we can see the immediate benefit of using an approximate method for PCA as provided by the BSPARAM argument in the following code, which utilizes the bench package for profiling: library(SingleCellExperiment) library(scater) ## Simulate a dataset with 1k genes and 1k cells mat &lt;- matrix(rpois(1e6, 100), nrow = 1000) tiny_sce &lt;- SingleCellExperiment(assays = list(counts = mat)) tiny_sce &lt;- normalize(tiny_sce) library(bench) library(BiocSingular) ## simple function to show only cols of interest .show_bench &lt;- function(b) { b[, c(&#39;expression&#39;, &#39;min&#39;, &#39;median&#39;, &#39;mem_alloc&#39;)] } bm &lt;- bench::mark( runPCA(tiny_sce, BSPARAM = IrlbaParam()), runPCA(tiny_sce, BSPARAM = ExactParam()), check = FALSE) .show_bench(bm) ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## expression min median mem_alloc ## &lt;bch:expr&gt; &lt;bch:tm&gt; &lt;bch:tm&gt; &lt;bch:byt&gt; ## 1 runPCA(tiny_sce, BSPARAM = IrlbaParam()) 222ms 223ms 0B ## 2 runPCA(tiny_sce, BSPARAM = ExactParam()) 733ms 733ms 0B We can see that the approximate, irlba based implementation is about 6 times faster than the exact version in this case. We can also try this with nearest neighbor searches. Here we provide the BNPARAM argument to build a shared nearest neighbors graph using different algorithms under the hood: library(scran) library(BiocNeighbors) ## Calculate PCA before testing NN back-ends tiny_sce_pca &lt;- runPCA(tiny_sce, BSPARAM = IrlbaParam()) bm &lt;- bench::mark( buildSNNGraph(tiny_sce_pca, BNPARAM = AnnoyParam()), buildSNNGraph(tiny_sce_pca, BNPARAM = KmknnParam()), check = FALSE) .show_bench(bm) ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## expression min median ## &lt;bch:expr&gt; &lt;bch&gt; &lt;bch:&gt; ## 1 buildSNNGraph(tiny_sce_pca, BNPARAM = AnnoyParam()) 1.57s 1.57s ## 2 buildSNNGraph(tiny_sce_pca, BNPARAM = KmknnParam()) 1.13s 1.13s ## # … with 1 more variable: mem_alloc &lt;bch:byt&gt; We can see from the above benchmark that in our tiny dataset, we don’t see much, if any, benefit of using an approximate method (via the AnnoyParam(), which uses the Annoy library). However, if we increase our dataset to something larger.. ## Simulate a dataset with 1k genes and 10k cells mat &lt;- matrix(rpois(10e6, 100), nrow = 1000) big_sce &lt;- SingleCellExperiment(assays = list(counts = mat)) big_sce &lt;- normalize(big_sce) ## Calculate PCA before testing NN back-ends big_sce &lt;- runPCA(big_sce, BSPARAM = IrlbaParam()) ## NN search bm &lt;- bench::mark( buildSNNGraph(big_sce, BNPARAM = AnnoyParam()), buildSNNGraph(big_sce, BNPARAM = KmknnParam()), check = FALSE) .show_bench(bm) ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## expression min median mem_alloc ## &lt;bch:expr&gt; &lt;bch:tm&gt; &lt;bch:t&gt; &lt;bch:byt&gt; ## 1 buildSNNGraph(big_sce, BNPARAM = AnnoyParam()) 10.2s 10.2s 0B ## 2 buildSNNGraph(big_sce, BNPARAM = KmknnParam()) 15.5s 15.5s 0B We see (more consistently) that we have realized some gains from using the approximate-based nearest neighbors search. 18.2 Parallelization Many tasks that arise in the analysis of scRNA-seq data are able to be parallelized. In other words, the problem can be broken down into smaller pieces that can be solved independently. Parallel computing can be performed in computing environments with access to multiple cores. Bioconductor has reduced the complexity of implementing parallelized software via the BiocParallel package. This enables a common interface across Bioconductor software packages for parallel computing. Across many Bioconductor packages, an argument that will often be present in functions that are parallelizable is the BPPARAM argument. Here, it is possible to specify the parallel back-end that can be used for evaluation. Again, note that parallelization does incur an overhead cost in splitting up the data, sending it off, and combining the results, and thus your mileage may vary depending on the specifics. Below is an example usage of the BiocParallel library supplying BPPARAM argument for constructing the UMAP representation from the PCA results: library(BiocParallel) bm &lt;- bench::mark( runUMAP(tiny_sce_pca, BPPARAM = SerialParam()), runUMAP(tiny_sce_pca, BPPARAM = MulticoreParam()), check = FALSE) .show_bench(bm) ## # A tibble: 2 x 4 ## expression min median mem_alloc ## &lt;bch:expr&gt; &lt;bch:&gt; &lt;bch:&gt; &lt;bch:byt&gt; ## 1 runUMAP(tiny_sce_pca, BPPARAM = SerialParam()) 3.71s 3.71s 0B ## 2 runUMAP(tiny_sce_pca, BPPARAM = MulticoreParam()) 4.69s 4.69s 0B On this dataset and equipment, there’s not much, if any, benefit to parallelization, but your mileage may vary dependent on those aspects. 18.3 On-Disk Data The matrix of data from a single-cell experiment can be on the order of tens to hundreds of gigabytes, depending on the number of features and cells measured. A standard approach to import and represent these matrices has been to load the entire data set into memory using either the matrix object in base R or sparse and dense matrix classes from the Matrix R package. This approach however may prove intractable in computing environments with limited memory. Disk-backed representations such as HDF5 free us from having to load an entire dataset into memory, and thus make it possible to work with large-scale scRNA-seq data. library(rhdf5) library(HDF5Array) Session Info View session info R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05) Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) Running under: Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS Matrix products: default BLAS/LAPACK: /app/easybuild/software/OpenBLAS/0.2.18-GCC-5.4.0-2.26-LAPACK-3.6.1/lib/libopenblas_prescottp-r0.2.18.so locale: [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8 [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C attached base packages: [1] parallel stats4 stats graphics grDevices utils datasets [8] methods base other attached packages: [1] HDF5Array_1.13.5 rhdf5_2.29.0 [3] BiocNeighbors_1.3.3 scran_1.13.13 [5] BiocSingular_1.1.5 bench_1.0.3 [7] scater_1.13.17 ggplot2_3.2.1 [9] SingleCellExperiment_1.7.7 SummarizedExperiment_1.15.8 [11] DelayedArray_0.11.4 BiocParallel_1.19.2 [13] matrixStats_0.54.0 Biobase_2.45.0 [15] GenomicRanges_1.37.14 GenomeInfoDb_1.21.1 [17] IRanges_2.19.14 S4Vectors_0.23.20 [19] BiocGenerics_0.31.5 BiocStyle_2.13.2 [21] Cairo_1.5-10 loaded via a namespace (and not attached): [1] viridis_0.5.1 edgeR_3.27.12 [3] viridisLite_0.3.0 DelayedMatrixStats_1.7.1 [5] RcppParallel_4.4.3 assertthat_0.2.1 [7] statmod_1.4.32 BiocManager_1.30.4 [9] dqrng_0.2.1 GenomeInfoDbData_1.2.1 [11] vipor_0.4.5 yaml_2.2.0 [13] pillar_1.4.2 lattice_0.20-38 [15] glue_1.3.1 limma_3.41.15 [17] digest_0.6.20 XVector_0.25.0 [19] colorspace_1.4-1 htmltools_0.3.6 [21] Matrix_1.2-17 pkgconfig_2.0.2 [23] bookdown_0.13 zlibbioc_1.31.0 [25] purrr_0.3.2 scales_1.0.0 [27] RSpectra_0.15-0 tibble_2.1.3 [29] withr_2.1.2 lazyeval_0.2.2 [31] cli_1.1.0 magrittr_1.5 [33] crayon_1.3.4 evaluate_0.14 [35] fansi_0.4.0 FNN_1.1.3 [37] beeswarm_0.2.3 tools_3.6.1 [39] stringr_1.4.0 Rhdf5lib_1.7.4 [41] munsell_0.5.0 locfit_1.5-9.1 [43] irlba_2.3.3 compiler_3.6.1 [45] rsvd_1.0.2 rlang_0.4.0 [47] grid_3.6.1 RCurl_1.95-4.12 [49] igraph_1.2.4.1 bitops_1.0-6 [51] rmarkdown_1.13 gtable_0.3.0 [53] R6_2.4.0 gridExtra_2.3 [55] knitr_1.24 dplyr_0.8.3 [57] uwot_0.1.3 utf8_1.1.4 [59] stringi_1.4.3 ggbeeswarm_0.6.0 [61] Rcpp_1.0.2 tidyselect_0.2.5 [63] xfun_0.9 library(scRNAseq) sce.grun &lt;- GrunPancreasData() # Converting back to Ensembl identifiers. library(org.Hs.eg.db) gene.symb &lt;- sub(&quot;__chr.*$&quot;, &quot;&quot;, rownames(sce.grun)) gene.ids &lt;- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys=gene.symb, keytype=&quot;SYMBOL&quot;, column=&quot;ENSEMBL&quot;) # Removing duplicated genes or genes without Ensembl IDs. keep &lt;- !is.na(gene.ids) &amp; !duplicated(gene.ids) sce.grun &lt;- sce.grun[keep,] rownames(sce.grun) &lt;- gene.ids[keep] library(scater) QC &lt;- perCellQCMetrics(sce.grun) filter &lt;- quickCellQC(QC, percent_subsets=&quot;altexps_ERCC_percent&quot;, nmads=3) sce.grun &lt;- sce.grun[,!filter$discard] library(scran) set.seed(1000) # for irlba. clusters &lt;- quickCluster(sce.grun) sce.grun &lt;- computeSumFactors(sce.grun, min.mean=0.1, clusters=clusters) sce.grun &lt;- logNormCounts(sce.grun) # Blocking on a combined plate and donor factor. block &lt;- paste0(sce.grun$sample, &quot;_&quot;, sce.grun$donor) dec.grun &lt;- modelGeneVarWithSpikes(sce.grun, spikes=&quot;ERCC&quot;, block=block) "],

["about-the-data.html", "Chapter 24 About the Data 24.1 10X Genomics PBMC Data 24.2 Cellbench_data", " Chapter 24 About the Data 24.1 10X Genomics PBMC Data The TENxPBMCData package provides a Bioconductor resource for representing and manipulating nine different single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data sets on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) generated by 10X Genomics from various healthy donors. Here we generally make use of the smaller datasets, pbmc3k and pbmc4k, available via the package. For more information, we refer to the 10X Genomics datasets online resource (PBMC data is within the Single Cell Gene Expression table). 24.2 Cellbench_data The 5 cell line scRNA-seq data from the CellBench_data repository is used in examples where having a cell label is important. In the CellBench_data repository, the data is stored within the workspace data/sincell_with_class_5cl.RData as sc_10x_5cl_qc. We have extracted it and saved it under this book’s Github repo within the _rfiles/_data folder for ease of use. The data arrives as a SingleCellExperiment class object, and has already undergone basic preprocessing, including quality control and normalization. The most important aspect to this data - the cell labels pertaining to the 5 cell lines sequenced - can be found within the colData component under the column name cell_line. Note that this data will be made available on Bioconductor via the scRNAseq package in the near future. "],
["about-the-contributors.html", "Chapter 25 About the Contributors", " Chapter 25 About the Contributors 25.0.1 Stephanie Hicks, PhD Stephanie Hicks is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her research interests focus around developing statistical methods, tools and software for the analysis of genomics data. Specifically, her research addresses statistical challenges in epigenomics, functional genomics and single-cell genomics such as the pre-processing, normalization, analysis of noisy high-throughput data leading to an improved quantification and understanding of biological variability. She actively contributes software packages to Bioconductor and is involved in teaching courses for data science and the analysis of genomics data. She is also a faculty member of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab, co-host of The Corresponding Author podcast and co-founder of R-Ladies Baltimore. For more information, please see http://www.stephaniehicks.com 25.0.2 Raphael Gottardo, PhD Raphael Gottardo is the Scientific Director of the Translational Data Science Integrated Research Center (TDS IRC) at Fred Hutch, J. Ordin Edson Foundation Endowed Chair, and Full Member within the Vaccine and Infectious Disease and Public Health Sciences Division. A pioneer in developing and applying statistical methods and software tools to distill actionable insights from large and complex biological data sets.In partnership with scientists and clinicians, he works to understand such diseases as cancer, HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis and inform the development of vaccines and treatments. He is a leader in forming interdisciplinary collaborations across the Hutch, as well as nationally and internationally, to address important research questions, particularly in the areas of vaccine research, human immunology, and immunotherapy. As director of the Translational Data Science Integrated Research Center, he fosters interaction between the Hutch’s experimental and clinical researchers and their computational and quantitative science colleagues with the goal of transforming patient care through data-driven research. Dr. Gottardo partners closely with the cancer immunotherapy program at Fred Hutch to improve treatments. For example, his team is harnessing cutting-edge computational methods to determine how cancers evade immunotherapy. He has made significant contributions to vaccine research and is the principal investigator of the Vaccine and Immunology Statistical Center of the Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery. 25.0.3 Robert Amezquita, PhD Robert Amezquita is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Immunotherapy Integrated Research Center (IIRC) at Fred Hutch under the mentorship of Raphael Gottardo. His current research focuses on utilizing computational approaches leveraging transcriptional and epigenomic profiling at single-cell resolution to understand how novel anti-cancer therapeutics - ranging from small molecule therapies to biologics such as CAR-T cells - affect immune response dynamics. Extending from his graduate work at Yale’s Dept. of Immunobiology, Robert’s research aims to better understand the process of immune cell differentiation under the duress of cancer as a means to inform future immunotherapies. To accomplish this, Robert works collaboratively across the Fred Hutch IIRC with experimental collaborators, extensively utilizing R and Bioconductor for data analysis. 25.0.4 Aaron Lun, PhD When one thinks of single-cell bioinformatics, one thinks of several titans who bestride the field. Unfortunately, they weren’t available, so we had to make do with Aaron instead. He likes long walks on the beach (as long as there’s Wifi) and travelling (but only in business class). His friends say that he is “absolutely insane” and “needs to get a life”, or they would if they weren’t mostly imaginary. His GitHub account is his Facebook and his Slack is his Twitter. He maintains more Bioconductor packages than he has phone numbers on his cell. He has a recurring event on his Google Calender to fold his laundry. He is - the most boring man in the world. (“I don’t often cry when I watch anime, but when I do, my tears taste like Dos Equis.”) He currently works as a Scientist at Genentech after a stint as a research associate in John Marioni’s group at the CRUK Cambridge Institute, which was preceded by a PhD with Gordon Smyth at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research.

This is the companion online book for the manuscript "Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor" by the Bioconductor community (2019).

To build the book, first run `_update.sh` to update the OSCABase submodule, render the test data workflows, and move all the markdowns to the top-level of the directory. Following that, run `_build.sh` to build the book. The build script calls `_render.R` to produce the specified versions of the book.

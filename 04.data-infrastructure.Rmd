# Data Infrastructure {#data-infrastructure}

One of the advantages of using Bioconductor packages is that they utilize common data infrastructures which makes analyses interoperable across various packages. Furthermore, much engineering effort is put into making this infrastructure robust and scalable. Here, we describe the _SingleCellExperiment_ object (or `sce` in shorthand) in detail to describe how it is constructed, utilized in downstream analysis, and how it stores various types of primary data and metadata.

## Prerequisites

The Bioconductor package `SingleCellExperiment` provides the `SingleCellExperiment` class for usage. While the package is implicitly installed and loaded when using any package that depends on the `sce` class, it can be explicitly installed (and loaded) as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install('SingleCellExperiment')
```

Additionally, we use some functions from the `scater` and `scran` packages, as well as the CRAN package `uwot` (which conveniently can also be installed through `BiocManager`). These functions will be accessed through the `<package>::<function>` convention as needed.

```{r eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install(c('scater', 'scran', 'uwot'))
```

For this session, all we will need loaded is the `SingleCellExperiment` package:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(SingleCellExperiment)
```


## The Essentials of `sce`

![Figure 1. Overview of the SingleCellExperiment object](_img/singlecellexperiment.png)

### Primary Data: The `assays` Slot

The `SingleCellExperiment` (`sce`) object is the basis of single-cell analytical applications based in Bioconductor. The `sce` object is an [S4 object](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s4.html), which in essence provides a more formalized approach towards construction and accession of data compared to other methods available in R. The utility of S4 comes from validity checks that ensure that safe data manipulation, and most important for our discussion, from its extensibility through _slots_.

If we imagine the `sce` object to be a ship, the _slots_ of `sce` can be thought of as individual cargo boxes - each exists as a separate entity _within_ the `sce` object. Furthermore, each slot contains data that arrives in its own format. To extend the metaphor, we can imagine that different variations of cargo boxes are required for fruits versus bricks. In the case of `sce`, certain slots expect numeric matrices, whereas others may expect data frames.

To construct a rudimentary `sce` object, all we need is a single slot:

* `assays` slot: contains primary data such as counts in list, where each entry of the list is in a matrix format, where rows correspond to features (genes) and columns correspond to samples (cells) (_Figure 1A, blue box_)

Let's start simple by generating three cells worth of count data across ten genes.

```{r countsmat}
counts_matrix <- data.frame(cell_1 = rpois(10, 10), 
                    cell_2 = rpois(10, 10), 
                    cell_3 = rpois(10, 30))
rownames(counts_matrix) <- paste0("gene_", 1:10)
counts_matrix <- as.matrix(counts_matrix) # must be a matrix object!
```

From this, we can now construct our first `SingleCellExperiment` object, using the defined _constructor_, `SingleCellExperiment()`. Note that we provide our data as a *named* _list_, and each entry of the list is a _matrix_. Here, we name the `counts_matrix` entry as simply `counts` within the list.

```{r}
sce <- SingleCellExperiment(assays = list(counts = counts_matrix))
```

To inspect the object, we can simply type `sce` into the console to see some pertinent information, which will display an overview of the various slots available to us (which may or may not have any data).

```{r}
sce
```

To access the count data we just supplied, we can do any one of the following:

* `assay(sce, "counts")` - this is the most general method, where we can supply the name of the assay as the second argument.
* `counts(sce)` - this is the same as the above, but *only* works for assays with the special name `"counts"`.

```{r}
counts(sce)
## assay(sce, "counts") ## same as above in this special case
```

### Extending the `assays` Slot

What makes the `assay` slot especially powerful is that it can hold _multiple_ representations of the primary data. This is especially useful for storing a _normalized_ version of the data. We can do just that as shown below, using the `scran` and `scater` packages to compute a log-count normalized representation of the initial primary data.

Note that here, we overwrite our previous `sce` upon reassigning the results to `sce` - this is because these functions _return_ a `SingleCellExperiment` object. Some functions - especially those outside of single-cell oriented Bioconductor packages - do not, in which case you will need to append your results to the `sce` object (see below).

```{r, message=FALSE}
sce <- scran::computeSumFactors(sce)
sce <- scater::normalize(sce)
```

Viewing the object again, we see that these functions added some new entries:

```{r}
sce
```

Specifically, we see that the `assays` slot has grown to be comprised of two entries: `counts` (our initial data) and `logcounts` (the normalized data). Similar to `counts`, the `logcounts` name is a special name which lets us access it simply by typing `logcounts(sce)`, although the longhand version works just as well.

```{r}
logcounts(sce)
## assay(sce, "logcounts") ## same as above
```

Notice that the data before had a severe discrepancy in counts between cells 1/2 versus 3, and that normalization has ameliorated this difference.

To look at all the available assays within `sce`, we can type:

```{r}
assays(sce)
```

While the functions above demonstrate automatic addition of assays to our `sce` object, there may be cases where we want to perform our own calculations and save the result into the `assays` slot. In particular, this is important for using functions that do _not_ return your `SingleCellExperiment` object. 

Let's append a new version of the data that has been offset by `+100`.

```{r}
counts_100 <- assay(sce, "counts") + 100
assay(sce, "counts_100") <- counts_100 # assign a new entry to assays slot
```

Then we can use the accessor `assays()` (notice this is plural!) to see all our entries into the `assay` slot that we have made so far. Note that to see the _names_ of all the assays, we use the plural `assays()` accessor, and to retrieve a single assay entry (as a matrix) we use the singular `assay()` accessor, providing the name of the assay we wish to retrieve as above.
 
```{r}
assays(sce)
```

These entries are also seen on the default view of `sce`:

```{r}
sce
```

This sort of extension of the `assays` slot is represented graphically in _Figure 1B (dark blue box)_, showing the addition of the `logcounts` matrix into the `assays` slot.

In a similar manner, many of the slots of `sce` are extendable through assignment as shown above, thus allowing for myriad custom functionality as needed for interoperability with functions outside of single-cell oriented Bioconductor packages.


### Column (Meta)Data: `colData` Slot

To further annotate our `sce` object, one of the first and most useful pieces of information is adding on metadata that describes the columns of our primary data, e.g. describing the samples or cells of our experiment. This data is entered into the `colData` slot:

* `colData` slot: metadata that describes that samples (cells) provided as a `data.frame` or (`DataFrame` if appending), where rows correspond to cells, and columns correspond to the sample (cells) metadata features (e.g. id, batch, author, etc.) (_Figure 1A, orange box_).

So, let's come up with some metadata for the cells, starting with a batch variable, where cells 1 and 2 are in batch 1, and cell 3 is from batch 2.

```{r}
cell_metadata <- data.frame(batch = c(1, 1, 2))
rownames(cell_metadata) <- paste0("cell_", 1:3)
```

Now, we can take two approaches - either append the `cell_metadata` to our existing `sce`, or start from scratch via the `SingleCellExperiment()` constructor and provide it from the get go. We'll start from scratch for now, but will also show how to append the data as well:

```{r}
## From scratch:
sce <- SingleCellExperiment(assays = list(counts = counts_matrix),
                           colData = cell_metadata)

## Appending to existing object (requires DataFrame() coercion)
## colData(sce) <- DataFrame(cell_metadata)
```

Similar to `assays`, we can see our colData is now populated from the default view of `sce`:

```{r}
sce
```

And furthermore access our column (meta)data with the accessor, `colData()`:

```{r}
colData(sce)
```

Finally, some packages automatically add to the `colData` slot, for example, the `scater` package features a function, `calculateQCMetrics()`, which appends a lot of quality control data. Here we show the first five columns of `colData(sce)` with the quality control metrics appended to it.

```{r}
sce <- scater::calculateQCMetrics(sce)
colData(sce)[, 1:5]
```

#### Using `colData` for Subsetting

A common operation with `colData` is its use in subsetting. One simple way to access `colData` is through the use of the `$` operator, which is a shortcut for accessing a variable within the `colData` slot:

```{r}
sce$batch
## colData(sce)$batch # same as above
```

If we only wanted cells within batch 1, we could subset our sce object as follows (remember, we subset on the _columns_ in this case because we are filtering by cells/samples here).

```{r}
sce[, sce$batch == 1]
```

### Feature Metadata: `rowData`/`rowRanges`

Lastly, the rows also have their own metadata slot to store information that pertains to the features of the `sce` object:

* `rowData` slot: contains data in a `data.frame` (`DataFrame`) format that describes aspects of the data corresponding to the rows of the primary data (_Figure 1A, green box_). 

Furthermore, there is a special slot which pertains to features with genomic coordinates:

* `rowRanges` slot: contains data in a `GRangesList` (where each entry is a `GenomicRanges` format) that describes the chromosome, start, and end coordinates of the features (genes, genomic regions).

Both of these can be accessed via their respective accessors, `rowRanges()` and `rowData()`. In our case, `rowRanges(sce)` produces an empty list:

```{r}
rowRanges(sce) # empty
```

However, our call to `calculateQCMetrics(sce)` in the prior section filled in the `rowData` slot of our `sce` object, as we can see below (only the first three columns are shown for brevity):

```{r}
rowData(sce)[, 1:3]
```

In a similar fashion to the `colData` slot, such feature metadata could be provided at the onset when creating the `SingleCellExperiment` object, which we leave up to the reader as an exercise.


#### Subsetting with on Rows

To subset an `sce` object down at the feature/gene level, we can do a row subsetting operation similar to other R objects, by supplying either numeric indices or a vector of names:

```{r}
sce[c("gene_1", "gene_4"), ]
## sce[c(1, 4), ] # same as above in this case
```

### Size Factors Slot: `sizeFactors`

Briefly, we already encountered this via the `scran::computeSumFactors(sce)` call, which adds a `sizeFactors` slot:

* `sizeFactors` slot: contains information in a numeric vector regarding the sample/cell normalization factors used to produce a normalize data representation (_Figure 1B, brown box_)

```{r}
sce <- scran::computeSumFactors(sce)
sce <- scater::normalize(sce)
sizeFactors(sce)
```

## A Brief Recap: From `se` to `sce`

So far, we have covered the `assays` (primary data), `colData` (sample metadata), `rowData`/`rowRanges` (feature metadata), and `sizeFactors` slots of `SingleCellExperiment`. 

What is important to note is that the `SingleCellExperiment` class _derives_ from the `SummarizedExperiment` (`se`) class, its predecessor, and in particular inherits the aforementioned slots. As such, much of the `SummarizedExperiment` functionality is retained in `SingleCellExperiment`. This allows existing methods that work with `SummarizedExperiment` to work similarly on `SingleCellExperiment` objects.

So what's new about the `SingleCellExperiment` class then? For our discussion, the most important change is the addition of a new slot called `reducedDims`.

## The `reducedDims` Slot

The `reducedDims` slot is a new addition which is specially designed to store the reduced dimensionality representations of primary data, such as PCA, tSNE, UMAP, and others. 

* `reducedDims` slot: contains a list of numeric `matrix` entries which describe dimensionality reduced representations of the primary data, such that rows represent the columns of the primary data (aka the samples/cells), and columns represent the dimensions

Most importantly, just like the `assays` slot, the `reducedDims` slot can hold a list of many entries. So, it can hold a PCA, TSNE, and UMAP representation of a given dataset all within the `reducedDims` slot.

In our example, we can calculate a PCA representation of our data as follows using the `scater` package function `runPCA()`. We see that the `sce` now shows a new `reducedDim` and that the accessor `reducedDim()` produces the results of running PCA on the normalized data from `logcounts(sce)`.

```{r}
sce <- scater::runPCA(sce)
reducedDim(sce, "PCA")
```

From this, we can also calculate a tSNE representation using the `scater` package function `runTSNE()`, and see that it can be seen both in the default view of `sce` and via accession:

```{r}
sce <- scater::runTSNE(sce, perplexity = 0.1)
reducedDim(sce, "TSNE")
```

We can view the names of all our entries in the `reducedDims` slot via the accessor, `reducedDims()` (notice that this is plural, and thus not the same as `reducedDim()`:

```{r}
reducedDims(sce)
```

Now, say we have a different dimensionality reduction approach which has not yet been implemented with `SingleCellExperiment` objects in mind. For example, let's say we want to try the `umap()` function as implemented in the `uwot` package (which is a much faster version of the default `umap` implementation currently in `scater`). 

Similar to how we extended the `assays` slot with our own custom entry of `counts_100`, we can do similarly for the `reducedDims` slot:

```{r}
u <- uwot::umap(t(logcounts(sce)), n_neighbors = 2)
reducedDim(sce, "UMAP_uwot") <- u

reducedDim(sce, "UMAP_uwot")
```

And we can also see its entry when we look at the `reducedDims()` accessor output:

```{r}
reducedDims(sce)
```

## One More Thing: `metadata` Slot

Some analyses produce results that do not fit into the aforementioned slots. Thankfully, there is a slot just for this type of messy data, and in fact, can accommodate any type of data, so long as it is in a named list:

* `metadata` slot: a named list of entries, where each entry in the list can be anything you want it to be

For example, say we have some favorite genes, such as highly variable genes, we want to save inside of `sce` for use in our analysis at a later point. We can do this simply by appending to the metadata slot as follows:

```{r}
my_genes <- c("gene_1", "gene_5")
metadata(sce) <- list(favorite_genes = my_genes)
metadata(sce)
```

Similarly, we can append more information via the `$` operator:

```{r}
your_genes <- c("gene_4", "gene_8")
metadata(sce)$your_genes <- your_genes
metadata(sce)
```

## About Spike-Ins

You might have noticed that the `sce` default view produces an entry with `spikeNames`. The `SingleCellExperiment` object contains some special considerations for experiments with spike-in (ERCC) controls. We leave this to the interested reader to learn more about in the [`SingleCellExperiment` introductory vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SingleCellExperiment/inst/doc/intro.html).

## Working with _SingleCellExperiment_

_Figure 1C_ shows an example workflow that uses the `SingleCellExperiment` object as its base, and similar to our walkthrough of the `sce` class above, continually appends new entries to save the results of the analysis. In the workflows that follow in this book, we will be similarly appending to an initial `sce` object many of our analytical results.
